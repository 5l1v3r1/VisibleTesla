		<h3>
			VisibleTesla 0.26.03 [04-20-2014]
		</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>User-Visible Changes
				<ul>
					<li>General
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="added">Addition for Windows Users</span>: I've added a clickable script in the VisibleTesla folder called "Make_Windows_Shortcut". If you double click this script it will create a shortcut on your desktop with a Tesla fob icon. You can use that to launch VisibleTesla. This effectively automates the manual steps listed in the FAQ.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="added">Addition for Mac Users</span>: Inside the VisibleTesla folder you'll now see VisibleTesla.app. You can use it to launch VisibleTesla. You can drag this to your dock or create an alias and put the alias anywhere you'd like. Do not move the app itself out of the downloaded folder. It relies on other content. You can move the entire downloaded folder anywhere you'd like.
							</li>
							<li>
								<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: The proxy fix that was introduced in 0.26.02 has been confirmed to work by several users so I removed the note about it being experimental. 
							</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: The charts and raw data displayed for <span class="ui">Vampire Loss</span> were always displaying range in terms of miles even when the car's interface was set to kilometers.

							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Charge
						<ul>
							<li>
								<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: The snowflake depicting cold weather conditions is actually not derived from the temperature. It was shown when the usable battery level differs from the "normal" battery level. Because I am actually not taking temperature into account (it is the implied reason for the lower usable level), I know longer show a snowflake. Instead, the Battery Gauge shows two distinct levels for this case. The lower level is the usable battery level and the higher level is the "normal" battery level. Both levels are shown at the bottom of the <span class="ui">Charging Data</span> table.
								<br><br>
								In the previous version the snowflake would be displayed no matter how insignificant the difference was between levels. This could lead to it being displayed for what were effectively rounding errors. Now the two levels are displayed in the gauge only if the difference is at least 5 percentage points.

When you receive a notification reminding you that your car is unplugged, you'll be able to see the remaining range and decide whether it is worth going out to plug in your car.

				VisibleTesla 0.26.02 [04-19-2014]
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>User-Visible Changes
					<ul>
						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: Modify to handle slightly different error codes from Tesla's server. This impacted the ability to gather location information even after Tesla's servers were fixed.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: Yet another attempt to make the proxy functionality work. It is now tested with one commercial http proxy and works in that test. The proxy functionality is described in the documentation for the <a href="pages/PrefsTab.html">Prefs Tab</a>. Look for the <span class="ui">Enable Proxy</span> setting.

								<li>
									<span class="added">Addition</span>: Added a speedometer/power readout in the upper right hand corner of the map. This is similar to what is displayed in Tesla's iPhone application, but shows not only the speed, but also an indication of relative power usage.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Charge
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="added">Addition</span>: Vehicles with firmware 5.9 or later have the ability to give a "usable battery level" reading. Tesla says:
									<blockquote>
										In cold weather, some of the stored energy in your Model S’s battery may not be available on your drive because the battery is too cold. When this happens, a portion of the battery meter will appear blue and the range value will have a snowflake image next to it. If your car is plugged in, you can heat your battery using wall power by turning on the Climate Control via the mobile app.
									</blockquote>
									In VisibleTesla, the charge tab reflects this with a snowflake over the battery gauge. When you see the snowflake, the gauge is displaying the usable battery level.

									<span class="added">Addition</span>: Customized Addresses and Subjects
									<p>
										Added the capbility to customize the messages sent for each notification. This allows you to override the email address and/or subject line for each type of notification. For example, you may configure the <span class="ui">Speed Hits or Exceeds</span> notification to be sent to a different email address than the one configured in the <a href="pages/PrefsTab.html">Prefs Tab</a>. You could also configure the subject of the <span class="ui">Charge State Becomes</span> notification to be a special word or phrase. This functionality can be used to take actions based on these notifications using a system like <a target="_blank" href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>.
									</p>
									<p>
										To use this feature, press the <span class="ui">+ button</span> at the far right of any notification definition. A dialog will pop up allowing you to specify an email address and/or a subject. You may also select <span class="ui">Use default values</span>, in which case the default email address and subject will be used. If you leave either field (email address or subject) blank, the default will be used for the blank item.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="added">Addition</span>: Geofencing <b><font color="red">[EXPERIMENTAL]</font></b>
									<p>
										You can now get a notification when your car enters a specified area or exists a specified area. These areas can be different. An area is defined by a location and a radius in meters. You set the location by typing in an address. The corresponding latitude and longitude are determined for you. A slider allows you to specify a radius around that location to yield the area of interest. You define this area by pressing the <span class="ui">Define Area</span> button next to the <span class="ui">Car entered area</span> or <span class="ui">Car left area</span> checkboxes.
									</p>
									<p>
										Pressing this button will pop up a dialog that lets you enter the address which defines the center of the area. You'll notice that the <span class="ui">OK</span> button is disabled any time you edit the address field. To make it active you must press the <span class="ui">Lookup</span> button. It will lookup the address and show it to you on a map to ensure it can be found and is what you intended. If it's not, you can change the address and try again. If it is what you want, just make sure the radius is set to your liking and hit <span class="ui">OK</span>.

				VisibleTesla 0.25.07 [02-23-2014] - EXPERIMENTAL
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>User-Visible Changes
					<ul>
						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: VisibleTesla used to overwrite its log file every time it runs. This made it easy to lose old logs if your not careful. The app now keeps around several old versions of the log file. Users need never pay attention to the log file unless they are reporting a bug.

							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="added">Addition</span>: Added a <span class="ui">Charge: Set</span> command that allows the user to change the charge target on a set schedule without actually initiating a charge. This is useful for cases when the user wants to use the car's built-in charge scheduler, but still wants to change the charge target.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: The temperature target was ignoring the units setting and always using fahrenheit.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: Using the Up/Down arrows to adjust the value of the temperature target could cause bad behavior (including a crash). This was caused by something outside of the control of VisibleTesla, so for the moment this functionality has been removed. The temperature target can only be set by adjusting the slider. The numeric field is for readout purposes only.

					<ul>
						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: More updates to the documentation to reflect these changes, additions, and fixes. Several typos were also corrected.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: Old log files are kept around for a while rather than being deleted immediately.

									<span class="added">Addition</span>:
									<p>
										You may now set the charge level as part of an <span class="ui">Charge: Start</span> command. When you choose <span class="ui">Charge: Start</span>, you'll notice that a button labeled "+" appears next to the command name. This indicates that there are additional options. If you press the button, a dialog will pop up allowing you to select the target charge level. When the <span class="ui">Charge: Start</span> command runs at its scheduled time, VisibleTesla will first set the charge target to the desired level.
									</p>
									<p>
										The charge level dialog lets you use a slider to select the target charge, or you can use the <span class="ui">Standard</span> or <span class="ui">Min</span> controls to jump to a setpoint. Alternatively, you can select the checkbox named "Use the car's set point". If you do that, the slider will be greyed out and the charge level will not be set to a new value. In this case, it will just use the car's current charge setting.
									</p>
									<p>
										Note that this option replaces the separate <span class="ui">Charge: Min</span>, <span class="ui">Charge: Min</span>, and <span class="ui">Charge: Max</span> commands. <font color="red">IMPORTANT: If you have used these commands in the past you must <b>manually</b> replace them with settings on the <span class="ui">Charge: Start</span> command.</font>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="added">Addition</span>:
									<p>
										You may now set the temperature as part of an <span class="ui">HVAC On</span>command. When you choose <span class="ui">HVAC On</span>, you'll notice that a button labeled "+" appears next to the command name. This indicates that there are additional options. If you press the button, a dialog will pop up allowing you to select the target temperature. When the <span class="ui">HVAC On</span> command runs at its scheduled time, VisibleTesla will first set the temperature to the desired level.
									</p>
									<p>
										The temperature options dialog lets you use a slider to select a temperature, or you can type a value into a text box. Alternatively, you can select a checkbox named "Use the car's set point". If you do that, the slider and text box will be greyed out and the temperature will not be set to a new value. In this case, it will just use the car's current temperature setting as it did in previous releases.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="added">Addition</span>:
									<p>
										There is now a "Once" checkbox for each scheduled item. If you select that checkbox, the scheduled item will automatically diable itself after it has been executed one time. For example, if you want to pre-heat your car tomorrow morning, but just tomorrow morning, you can create a scheduled item to do that. Select the "Once" checkbox and your car will pre-heat tomorrow morning, but that schedule will be automatically disabled so you don't have to remember to go and disable it yourself.
									</p>
									<p>
										<font color="red">IMPORTANT: If you have used previous versions of VisibleTesla you must manually ensure the proper settings of the "Once" checkbox. Make sure you turn it off for any existing scheduled items.</font>
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Changed</span>: The "Safe" checkbox has been removed. It was only used for one command - HVAC On. Instead of taking up space in the UI for an option that isn't used for the majority of commands, safe mode will always apply to HVAC On. Remember that you can use the Prefs Tab to set safe mode to mean:
									<ul>
										<li>At least 25% charge on the battery
										</li>
										<li>Car is plugged in
										</li>
										<li>Both
										</li>
										<li>Neither
										</li>
									</ul>If you don't want safe mode, use "neither". Otherwise choose the combo that makes you most comfortable.

									<span class="added">Addition</span>: Experimental support for the "Snap to Road" option. If you check this box, VisibleTesla will <i>try</i> to make the path follow roadways rather than plot straight lines between markers. This is just a guess and can be wrong. The only data VisibleTesla is sure of are the marker locations. This option uses data from Google to help perform the "snapping". Google limits the rate at which this service can be used, so this option can be slow.This setting is <b>not</b> remembered between runs of VisibleTesla. That may change in future versions if this feature gets past the experimental stage.

				VisibleTesla 0.25.03 [01-18-2014]
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>User-Visible Changes
					<ul>
						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="added">Addition</span>: You can now select a date range when exporting Location data or Statistics data. Please see the documentation for details.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: More work on sleep mode. <b>Remember that when VisibleTesla is in sleep mode, its first priority is to allow your car to sleep. It will miss data in this mode. The only question is how much</b>. I've added more heuristics that will minimize the amount of missed data, but it will always miss some. After all, it is actively trying to leave the car alone.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: Additions and updates to the documentation. Note that many of the screen shots have not been updated to reflect the latest version.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strike><span class="fixed">Fix</span>: VisibleTesla keeps several files that store statistics and location data. If you run multiple copies of VisibleTesla on the same computer and connected to the same car, both copies might write to the files at the same time. The result is not pretty. In this version, if you try to run two copies of VT pointed at the same vehicle, the second copy of VT will pop up a dialog with a warning message and then exit. You can still run multiple copies of VT, but each must be pointed at a different vehicle.</strike>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Login
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="added">Addition</span>: If you log in when the car is sleeping, you'll get the normal dialog box that asks you whether you want to wake up the car or let it sleep. In previous versions if you chose to let it sleep, VT would simply exit. Now it overlays the login Tab with a panel saying that the car is asleep and the app will start automatically when it notices that the car is awake. There is also a "Wake" button that you can press at any time to force the car to wake up. You can also quit the app at any time while it is in this mode.
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: There was a situation where the app would successully log in but then get stuck on the Login tab. This was caused by an underlying problem communicating with the car. The login activity only communicates with Tesla's servers. That means that the login can succeed even if the car cannot be contacted. In the latest version users will be presented with a Dialog explaining that a problem has occurred and what to do instead of just a silent failure.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Overview
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: The area on the overview tab that used to display the car's VIN will now allow the user to toggle between displaying the VIN or the firmware version. The toggle setting is remembered between runs of the application. You can toggle back and forth between VIN and firmware version all you want while running the app. If you quit and restart, VisibleTesla will begin in whatever state you left it in (displaying VIN or firmware version).
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>HVAC
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: The temperature range slider now covers the same range of temperatures as the iPhone app and the car itself. When the units are Fahrenheit the range is 62 (LO) to 90 (HI). when the units are Celsius the range is 17 (LO) to 32 (HI).
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: There was a problem experienced by some European users that caused any change to the temperature to result in the temperature being set to the lowest setting (LO). It is possible for users in the US to experience this problem but only if the language setting on their computer is something other than US English (e.g. German).

								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: Yet more work on tracking down problems with units.
									<ul>
										<li>The elevation series in the graph is now in meters or feet depending on the car's GUI setting (feet if set for miles, meters if set for km).
										</li>
										<li>Speed in the map (shown when hovering over a marker) and speed in the graph now reflect the car's gui setting (mph or km/h).
										</li>
										<li>The two y-axes are now as follows: The left y-axis represents elevation (in feet or meters as displayed in the legend). The right y-axis gives speed and power.
										</li>
										<li>The "Speed" and Power legends now shows units (mph or km/h and kW respectively)
										</li>
										<li>When hovering over a map marker, the displayed speed is now labeled with the appropriate units.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="fixed">Fix</span>: Problem where mapping multiple trips with an embedded graph would not work. The graph represented only the first trip rather than all of the segments.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Scheduler
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="changed">Refinement</span>: Executing a scheduled event will now wake up the application in addition to waking up the car. The exception is if the command to be executed is to put the app into sleep mode.

				VisibleTesla 0.25.02 [01-01-14]
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>User-Visible Changes
					<ul>
						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>Continued tweaks to "Allow Sleeping" mode. It is now a little better at capturing trips while the app is in this mode. It's still possible to miss all or part of a trip while in this mode, but if the app detects that the car is awake while it is in "Allow Sleeping" mode and that the car is in motion, it will poll more frequently until motion stops.
								</li>
								<li>Revamped the format of the documentation and updated a few sections. Added an FAQ.
								</li>
								<li>Fixed one or two places where unit conversion wasn't happening. There are more to come.

						<li>Trips
							<ul>
								<li>Added an "Export It" button right next to the "Map It" button. Pressing this button will create a .kmz file which is input to Google Earth. Among other things, this will allow you to visualize your elevation profile over the course of the selected trip and let you watch your motion through the trip.<br>
									<strong>Usage Notes</strong>:
									<ul>
										<li>When entering a name for the output file, be sure to use a ".kmz" extension (e.g. MyTrip.kmz).
										</li>
										<li>Double-click your .kmz file to open Google Earth, or use the File-&gt;Open menu in Google Earth to select and open the .kmz file you just exported.
										</li>
										<li>What follows is not meant to be a guide to Google Earth. Please refer to Google's documentation. The following simply provides a couple of interesting things you can do with this data.
										</li>
										<li>When Google Earth opens, you'll see a "Places" panel on the left hand side. Inside that panel you'll see a folder named "Temporary Places" and inside that you'll see the name of the file you just created (e.g. MyTrip.kmz).
										</li>
										<li>Click the triangle next to your trip and you'll see two items. The first will be labeled "Tesla Path on [date @ time]
										</li>
										<li>Left-click that item and select "Show Elevation Profile." As the name implies, it will show you the elevations along your path. These elevations are not from the car's GPS. It is Google's elevation data for the specified vehicle locations.
										</li>
										<li>In the bottom right of the places pane you'll see an icon that is similar to the one next to your selected item (it is 3 dots connected by lines). If you press this button you'll be taken on a virtual tour through your data.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Added an "Include graph in Map?" checkbox. If you check this box then the resulting page will include not only the map, but a graph of some basic values for each point along the route. The data currently provided is Elevation (in meters), Speed, and Power. Note the elevations displayed are not from the car's GPS. It is Google's elevation data for the specified vehicle locations. Google allows a limited number of elevation queries per day from a given user (2500 requests, 25,000 total elevations). This should be enough for normal usage.<br>
									<strong>Usage Notes</strong>:
									<ul>
										<li>If you select a legend item (such as "Speed") it will toggle that series on or off in the chart. When it is off, the legend item will appear greyed out.
										</li>
										<li>If you select a point on one of the lines in the graph, the corresponding car marker in the map will highlight (it will get bigger and turn yellow).
										</li>
										<li>If you select a car marker in the map, it will select the corresponding data points in the chart.

							<ul>
								<li>The subject of the email notification now contains up to 80 characters of the body of the message. That allows users to get the point of the message just by seeing the subject.

				VisibleTesla 0.25.01 [12-24-13] - EXPERIMENTAL
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>User-Visible Changes
					<ul>
						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>This version should continue to be considered experimental. The Trips tab, Notify Tab, and sleep modes are still undergoing changes.
								</li>
								<li>Enhancements to "Allow Sleeping" Mode. The result is that the app is now smarter about getting the data from the vehicle if it happens to be awake, but will not keep the car awake by continually sending it commands. For example, if the car wakes up overnight to perform a scheduled charge, VisibleTesla will notice that and grab some data while the car is awake. Details are below but can be skipped.
									<ul>
										<li>A fairly significant change has been made to the way VisibleTesla handles sleep mode. If the app is in "Allow Sleep" mode, it will not interact with the car, thereby allowing it to go to sleep if it so chooses. VisibleTesla will not interact with the vehicle again until a scheduled command requires it, or the user starts interacting with the app again.
										</li>
										<li>This new version of the app operates slightly differently. When the app is in "Allow Sleep" mode, the car may or may not be awake. Allow Sleep mode doesn't put the car to sleep - it just leaves it alone so that it may enter sleep mode when it is appropriate. Knowing that the car may still be awake, VisibleTesla now probes Tesla's servers periodically to determine if the car is really asleep. This probe will not wake up the car. If the car is asleep, then the app does nothing and will probe again later.
										</li>
										<li>If VisibleTesla determines that the car is still awake, it will gather some data and then will not probe the vehicle again for 30 minutes. This is enough time to let the car go to sleep if it wants to. There is one final wrinkle. If, during one of these probes, VisibleTesla determines that the car is charging, then it will continue to probe more frequently until a probe shows that the car is no longer charging.
										</li>
										<li>These changes will allow VisibleTesla to gather more information from your car with little to no impact on the car's ability to sleep. With more information, the app can keep more complete statistics, send notifications on a more timely basis, etc.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Tesla seems to have a few new codes for wheel, battery, and seat types (WT1P, WTX1, QZMB, PBT85). I have incorporated support for these based on user input. Not having these types in VT resulted in misidentification of these items and also the paint color. That is now corrected. This impacts the Overview and the HVAC tabs.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Fixed:</strong> A problem that could result in a hang at startup in rare circumstances.
								</li>
								<li>Fixed the format of decimal numbers in various places to be sensitive to the locale. For example, in the US a user might see "50.0" in some part of the UI while a user in Europe might see "50,0". This is dependent on the region and language settings in the underlying operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux). Advanced users may override this by launching java manually with additional commaned line parameters such as "-Duser.country=NL -Duser.language=nl". If you don't know what this means, but for some reason need to use a different locale for this app than you do in the rest of the operating system, please let me know.

						</li>
						<li>Charge
							<ul>
								<li>Changed the units from "kph" to "km/h".
								</li>
								<li>The app now determines whether this is a European vehicle, and if so checks whether the connected power is 3-phase. If it is 3-phase, the "Current" row in the Property table will show a (3) after the word "Current".

						<li>Trips
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Fixed:</strong> A problem that would cause the units to be repeated over and over again in the Property table. For example: "Range (mi) (mi) (mi)".
								</li>
								<li>If a new trip completes while the current day is selected, that trip would not appear in the list of available trips until the day is deselected and reselected. The trip is now added to the list automatically.
								</li>
								<li>When a day or days are selected, all available trips from those days are displayed in the trip list. Each is listed as "day @ time". For example: "2013-12-23 @ 08:57". To make it easier to identify which trip is which, the trips are now listed as "day @ time, N units". For example, "2013-12-23 @ 08:57, 9.6 mi".
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Scheduler
							<ul>
								<li>Added a new command: "Unplugged?". This command tests whether the car is unplugged at the specified time and sends the user a notification if it is. <strong>Note:</strong> This scheduled command will wake up your car if it is sleeping. The car must be awake in order to communicate whether it is plugged in or not. This command will wake up your car even if VisibleTesla is in "Allow Sleep" mode. The same holds for some other scheduler commands such as "HVAC: On".
								</li>
								<li>Users reported confusion when a particular row of the Scheduler was turned off. It was unclear that is was disabled and they were surprised that the event didn't execute. As a result, the app now disables (greys out) all items in the row when the "On?" checkbox is deselected.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Notify
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Fixed:</strong> A problem that would allow the "Unplugged at time" notification to trigger at incorrect times.
								</li>
								<li>The "Unplugged at time" notification is now part of the Scheduler tab since it is a scheduled event.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Fixed:</strong> A problem that would make the tab unusable for some European users.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Prefs
							<ul>
								<li>Added a "Test Delivery" button next to the "Email for notifications" field in General-&gt;Basic preferences. This allows you to ensure that the email address you are using for notifications can be delivered to by VisibleTesla. If you have difficulty receiving notifications, this test can help diagnose the problem.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Under-the-covers
					<ul>
						<li>Lots of logging information is being kept in this version related to sleep mode. User won't see this unless they look in VisibleTesla.log. Once this code has been determined to work well, the logging code will be removed.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Known problems
					<ul>
						<li>The Rated, Estimated, and Ideal range displays on the Charge tab do not honor the current locale setting. They always display decimal numbers with a "." and not a ",". This appears to be a limitation of the underlying component. I'm looking into it.

						<li>Charge
						</li>
						<li>Graphs
						</li>
						<li>Trips
							<ul>
								<li>Rearranged the layout of the Trips tab to allow for the selection of multiple trips. A typical use case is that you start a trip, stop for lunch, then continue the trip. This will show up as two trips. Now you can select them both and show them on the same map.
								</li>
								<li>Each segment will still be displayed with distinct stop and start points (i.e. each trip will begin with a green marker and and with a black one.). No line will be drawn between the position of the car at the end of one trip and the beginning of the next. This works fine in the scenario given above and also if you select truly disjoint trips.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Fixed:</strong> The wrong Google Maps API key was being used when displaying Trips. This could cause missing map data for some users. The proper API key is now being used.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Fixed:</strong> The Trips tab would not display any trip that was taken after the app was launched. You would see all trips that occurred before launching VisibleTesla, but new trips would not be visible without restarting the application. Now all completed trips are visible; even those that occurred after the app launched.
								</li>
								<li>Notes:
									<ul>
										<li>If a trip is currently in progress it can be monitored on the Location tab, but it won't be shown on the Trips tab until it is complete.
										</li>
										<li>Remember that VisibleTesla has to guess what constitutes a trip. It typically waits for the car to be stationary for 15 minutes before declaring a trip complete. Thus the current trip won't be available in the Trips tab until ~15 minutes after it is complete.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Scheduler
						</li>
						<li>Notify
							<ul>
								<li>Added a new Notify tab. It allows you to request notifications when certain types of events occur. For example, if your SOC drops below a certain level or rises above a certain level. The set of notifications is fairly limited.
								</li>
								<li>This version should be considered <strong>experimental</strong>. Notifications are sent via email and the address is specified in the General Preferences.
								</li>
								<li>With all wireless carriers I know of in the US, you can enter an email address that corresponds to your cell phone's phone number. This will allow you to receive notifications as text messages or emails.
								</li>
								<li>The notifications will be sent via a hosted service and will not require you to enter your email credentials - just an email address. This does not hae to be the same address that you use as your Tesla login.
								</li>
								<li>Messages are sent from the address "notifier@visibletesla.com"
								</li>
								<li>The available notification types are:
									<ul>
										<li>SOC Hits or Exceeds: Sends a notification if the State of Charge (SOC) climbs to or beyond a user specified value. Note that the SOC must cross a threshold to get to this value. For example, if you specifiy 85% as the target, the SOC must go from a value below 85% to 85% or above for a notification to be sent. A notification will not be sent if the SOC is already at or above 85% when the app starts up.
										</li>
										<li>SOC Falls Below:Sends a notification if the SOC falls below a user specified value.
										</li>
										<li>Charge State Becomes: Sends a notification if the Charge State status changes to a given value such as "Disconnected" or changes to any value.
										</li>
										<li>Unplugged at time: Sends a notification if the car is not plugged in at a given time.
										</li>
										<li>Speed Hits or Exceeds: Sends a notification if the car exceeds a user specified value. Note that once a notification has been sent for this, another notification will not be sent for at least 30 minutes. For example, if you set the target to 70 mph, and your speed hits or exceeds 70, a notification will be sent, but another notification will not be sent for at least 30 minutes even if you fall below 70 and then go back above it many times.
										</li>
										<li>Scheduler Event Triggered: Sends a notification if any time a Scheduler activity occurs.
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>Each notification type can be enable or disabled individually.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Preferences
							<ul>
								<li>General/Advanced: Added an option that allows power users to use their own Google Maps API key. DO NOT check this box unless you know what this means and have a valid API key issued by Google. If you get this wrong, the Location tab and the Trips tab will fail without notice.

						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>Added the Trips tab. See below for details.
								</li>
								<li>Changed the "File-&gt;Export Graph Data" menu item to "File-&gt;Export Stats Data"
								</li>
								<li>Added a "File-&gt;Export Location Data" menu item. If you are collecting location data (see the new preference) then this will allow you to export that data.
								</li>
								<li>When data is exported to Excel format (either stats or location data), the header row is frozen. When you open the file in Excel (or similar) the header row will remain stationary when you scroll the data up and down. This allows you to always see the column labels.
								</li>
								<li>Hopefully you'll never see this, but the way error logging is done has changed. The log is now stored in a file called "visibletesla.log" and captures more information than it used to. This file is stored in the application folder and you should never have to look at it.

						<li>Location
							<ul>
								<li>Location data is now stored persistently by the application. This information is used by the new Trips tab. The amount of data that gets stored is controlled by the Location preferences.

								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Charge
						</li>
						<li>Graphs
							<ul>
								<li>VisibleTesla starts collecting statistics at launch. You no longer need to go to the Graphs tab to start the collection process.
								</li>
								<li>The Graphs tab now collects data whenever any part of the app probes the vehicle. It collects statistics on a regular basis as always, but it will also store statistics opportunistically when another part of the application happens to have additional data. This is most relevant when you are on the Location tab. As it collects location data, that information is now shared with the Graphs tab so that it will have additional samples. This means you may see more samples than you normally would.
								</li>
								<li>The way data is loaded has completely changed. It no longer loads incrementally with the progress bar displayed at the bottom of the window. It now loads all at once when you select the Graph tab. This may take a few seconds depending on how much data you've chosen to import. The overall load time is much shorter.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Trips
							<ul>
								<li>This new tab allows you to view previous trips that have been captured by VisibleTesla. The app looks at stored location information and tries to break the data up into separate trips. Your drive to work in the morning would be one trip, your drive home at night would be another. An outing to a restaurant would be another.
								</li>
								<li>The tab displays a calendar and allows you to select the day or days that contain the trips you're interested in reviewing. When you select a day (or range of days), a drop down list is populated with all of the trips in that time span. Select any trip and click the "Map It" button. A new browser window will appear with a Google map that plots your trip.
								</li>
								<li>The map will contain a marker showing the location of the vehicle every time a reading was taken. If you hover your mouse above one of these markers, it will show you the date and time that the car was at that location and the speed it was traveling at the time.
								</li>
								<li>When a trip is selected from the dropdown, some basic information about the trip is displayed in a table in the tab. The table shows the following information (if available):
									<ul>
										<li>Starting and Ending Range

								<li>Location: Add a "Collect Location Data" checkbox. If this is checked, the application will store location data captured by the Location tab, the Graphs tab, or any other part of the application that happens to have location data available. This stored information can be used by the Trips tab. Along with this checkbox there are two new sliders that govern how much location information to collect. One slider puts a limit on how much time must elapse between stored samples and the other indicates the minimum distance between samples. For example, you might say not to store a new sample until 10 seconds have elapsed between the last sample. You might also say not to store a new sample until the car has moved at least 10 meters from the previous sample.
								</li>
								<li>Graphs: There are no longer any Graphs preferences. The preference for how much data to load is now part of General preferences. The incremental load option (under advanced) has been removed.
								</li>
								<li>General: Moved the preference for how much data to load into General preferences from Graphs preferences. Moved "Offer Experimental Versions" to the Advanced section

						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>Added experimental support for proxy servers. If you don't know what proxy servers are and are able to login using VisibleTesla, you can completely ignore this feature. I don't have a great way to test this, hence the experimental status. I will work on creating a test network environment with an http proxy but also welcome feedback from users.

							<ul>
								<li>Changed the temperature control interface. Rather than simulating the car's actual temperature control which has buttons that move the target temperature up or down by one degree, there is now a slider that allows the user to select a specific temperature without having to click repeatedly. When the car is in Celsius mode, the slider ranges from 18 to 27 degrees and has steps at every half degree (18, 18.5, 19, 195, etc.). When the car is in Fahrenheit mode, the slider ranges from 65 to 80 degrees with stops at every degree. VisibleTesla displays the numberic temperature corresponding to the slider position in real time as the slider moves, however, the app only sends a command to the car when the user finally stops moving the slider. This reduces unneccesary communication with the car and with Tesla's servers.

				VisibleTesla 0.22.01 [11-16-13]
			</h3>
			<p>
				<font color="red">Experimental</font> : This version has a lot of changes to the preferences code and a number of other places. Thank you to the adventurous of you who try this version out. I will remove the experimental label once I get enough feedback to let me know that this release is working. Otherwise I'll make the required fixes and the next version won't be marked as experimental. Note that one of the new features in this version is that the auto-update mechanism can look for and either ignore or offer experimental versions based on your preferences.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>User-Visible Changes
					<ul>
						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>There have been major changes to the way that preferences work under the covers. As a result, you may find that one or two of your old settings may need to be manually reset. I tried to catch all of the cases where changes may lead to this, but I can't guarantee that I did. For example, if you have the Graph Load Period set to "7 Days", please go check that it didn't get reset to antoher value (like "All"). I apologize for any inconvenience.
								</li>
								<li>When checking for updates the app will test whether an available update is an experimental version. If it is, it will only be offered for download if the "Offer Experimental Versions" checkbox is selected in the General preferences.
								</li>
								<li>Now that I have a vehicle with version 5.8, I can start testing more of the sleep-related areas. Several changes have been made to better accomodate waking from sleep mode. I'm sure more will be necessary.

							<ul>
								<li>Changes to the "loading" screen to display a little "radar blip" while the actual location is being determined and the Google map is loading. This was more for my amusement than anything practical.
								</li>
								<li>The heading for a car that is coming out of sleep mode is not accurate. I do what I can to choose an accurate value, but ultimately Tesla needs to address this since it affects them also.

						<li>Charge
						</li>
						<li>Graphs
						</li>
						<li>Scheduler
						</li>
						<li>Preferences
							<ul>
								<li>General: Added a checkbox that lets the user determine whether clicking on a tab should cause a refresh and consequently wake up the car if it is sleeping. If this box is unchecked, clicking on a tab while in sleep mode will not refresh the data (meaning it will be stale). This allows the user to look at the last data displayed in a tab without waking the car up.
								</li>
								<li>General: Added a slider to allow the user to set the Idle Threshold. This determines how long the app will look for inactivity before entering Sleep or Daydream mode. The default is 15 minutes. It can be set to anywhere between 1 and 90 minutes.
								</li>
								<li>General: Added a checkbox labeled "Offer Experimental Versions". It is unchecked by default. If it is checked, then the app will offer experimental versions as part of the normal process of checking for updates.
								</li>
								<li>General (Advanced): Rearranged the UI a little and added a warning. No change in functionality, just presentation.
								</li>
								<li>Graphs: Added a "None" option to the "Time Period to Load" preference. In this case none of your existing data will be loaded. The graph will stsart out empty and then will fill with new data as it becomes available.
								</li>
								<li>Scheduler: Added checkboxes that allow the user to determine what "Safe?" means when it it selected in the Scheduler UI. In the past it meant that the battery must have a minimum charge remaining for the command to execute. Now users can select "Minimum Battery Power" or "Vehicle Plugged-In" or both.

				</li>
				<li>Under-the-covers
					<ul>
						<li style="list-style: none">Major refactoring of the way preferences work in the code. This will allow changes to be visible immediately rather than after a restart. For some things this doesn't make sense and a notice will be given if a restart is necessary. This also makes it much easier to add preferences in the future.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Known problems
					<ul>
						<li>Cars with version 5.8 (perhaps earlier versions of 5 also) will report inaccurate heading information after being asleep. NOTE: The in-car map also displays faulty heading information after sleep mode. This is something Tesla needs to fix.

The best way to have a smooth transition is to follow these steps:

										<li>The first change comes in the way that markers are drawn. I do it manually now as opposed to letting the underlying graphics library do it for me.
										</li>
										<li>The second change has to do with sampling. If you are zoomed out and consequently displaying a lot of data, many of the points may be right on top of one another. For example, if you are showing a month's worth of data, you can't possibly see separate data points that were taken 30 seconds apart. They'll fall right on top of each other on the screen. Rather than draw all of those overlapping data points, I only draw one. As you zoom in, you'll see a single data point resolve into multiple data points.

						<li>General

								<li>Added "Check for Updates" functionality. This is the first step towards auto update. When the app launches it will check the web for a newer version. If there is one, a dialog box will be displayed with a download link and a link to the new release notes. It will only do this once per week. If you want to check for a newer version earlier than that, use the "Help-&gt;Check For Updates" menu item.
								</li>
								<li>Additional error handling if VisibleTesla is unable to communicate with the car. For example, if the car is sleeping and can't be awoken.
								</li>
								<li>Fixes to a few edge cases in the way inactivity is handled.
								</li>
								<li>Updated the look of dialog boxes to be more native to the platorm (Windows, Mac, Linux) than they used to be. This primarily affects the window borders and controls. The content of the dialog boxes remains the same.

						<li>HVAC
						</li>
						<li>Location
							<ul>
								<li>
									<strong>Experimental</strong> support for streaming updates to the map location. In this version the location of the marker will update in near-real-time as the car is moving. The frequency of updates is a maximum of 4 times/second, but may not be at that rate. There may be times when Tesla's servers do not stream at that rate or network delays slow down the updates. It will continue to auto-refresh every 20 seconds as usual.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Charge
						</li>
						<li>Graphs
							<ul>
								<li>More work to overcome limitations in the underlying graphing library. Statistics are now loaded in the background starting from the present time and working backwards to the oldest statistics. This allows the suer to see and start interacting with the most recent data in the graph right away.
								</li>
								<li>While loading the Graphs tab now displays a two-part progress bar along the bottom of the tab. The first part of the progress bar represents the progress in loading the visible series. Those are the series that are selected in the "Show Items" drop down list. Visible series are loaded first. The second part of the progress bar represents the progress in loading the currently hidden series. The size of these two parts are proportional to the number of hidden and visible series. For example, if 4 of the 8 possible series are visible, then the two parts of the progress bar will be the same size. If 2 of the 8 are visible, then the first part will be a quarter of the total size and the second part will be three quarters.
								</li>

						<li>Changes to the JavaFX LineChart and XYChart classes for better performance. This is achieved through subclassing, not changes to the core library.
						</li>
						<li>Fairly major changes to the code to work around graphics performance issues - at least to make performance tolerable for "large" datasets.
						</li>
						<li>Forked the javafx-dialogs code to add the ability to get a more native look on each platform. Updated the README.md file to reflect where to download my forked version. Trying to figure out how to get it integrated into the main repository.

				VisibleTesla 0.20.01 [10-05-13]
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>User-Visible Changes
					<ul>
						<li>General
							<ul>
								<li>Added experimental support for multiple vehicles on the same account. When you log in, VisbleTesla will determine whether there are multiple vehicles on your account. If there are, you're a lucky devil! In this case you will be prompted to select which vehicle you want to use. There is currently no way to change the selection without restarting the app. Since I don't have more than one Tesla, I have not been able to test this.
								</li>
								<li>The auto-refresh time is now 30 seconds instead of 20 seconds.
								</li>
								<li>Pressing the refresh button repeatedly in rapid succession will <strong>not</strong> invoke the refresh function over and over. Rapid repeated presses will be ignored so a backlog of requests won't build up. This is true for all tabs.
								</li>
								<li>The Menu structure has been modified. The 3 top level menus are:
									<ul>
										<li>File: contains "Export Graph Data..." and "Close".
										</li>
										<li>Options: contains two submenus - "Inactivity Mode" and "Simulate".
										</li>
										<li>Help: contains "About", "Documentation", and "What's new".
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li>The "Allow Sleeping" menu item is now part of the Inactivity submenu of the options menu. The Inactivity submenu contians three mutually exclusive options - if you select one option, the previously selected option will be deselected. The options are "Allow Sleeping", "Allow Daydreaming", and "Stay Awake". "Allow Sleeping" acts just as before. When "Allow Daydreaming" is selected it tells the app to stop auto-refreshing after 15 minutes of inactivity. The scheduler will continue to run and the Graphs Tab will continue to collect data. Your vehicle will not be able to go to sleep in this mode, but the load on Tesla's servers is reduced. By default, this menu item is selected. When "Stay Awake" is selected the app will not sleep or daydream. VisibleTesla remembers which of these three choices you have selected even if you quit and restart.
								</li>
								<li>
									<strong>Fixed</strong>: A new type of seat has been added to the list. This only shows up in the "Details" display from the Overview tab. The seat type hadn't been seen before. It is "Perf Leather with Grey Piping, White". The code that Tesla uses for this is IZZW.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Login
						</li>
						<li>Overview
							<ul>
								<li>The odometer reading is only available through the streaming API. In some cases this can require several requests to Tesla's servers to retreive. Since even at 60 mph the reading doesn't change much every minute, the app no longer updates the reading on every refresh. If the user presses the refresh button, it will force a new reading. Otherwise it is updated on every third auto-refresh.
								</li>
								<li>At the very bottom of the details dialog (presented when you press the Details button), there is a new item called "Low level information". It is one very long line of detailed information that is only of use for debugging or for the technically curious. This same line of information is written to the tesla.log file when the application starts.

								<li>Based on user feedback, I have modified the way lines are displayed in the graph. If you have chosen to display both lines and markers, the lines will display as thin and semi-transparent. This is the same as version 0.20.00. If you choose to display only the lines (no markers) then the lines will be displayed thicker and solid.
								</li>
								<li>Loading a graph with many data points and a display mode that includes Markers (not just lines) can take a long time. The progress spinner is now displayed during this period as well as a "Loading" message.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Scheduler
							<ul>
								<li>There are three new commands available to the scheduler: "Awake", "Sleep", and "Daydream". When one of these is executed, it is equivalent to the user selecting "Stay Awake", "Allow Sleeping", or "Allow Daydreaming" from the "Options-&gt;Inactivity Mode" menu. This can be used, for example, to tell the app to sleep at night and daydream during the day. Note that executing one of these commands simply causes the app to enter the associated inactivity mode. The app must still be idle for 15 minutes before it will sleep or daydream.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Under-the-covers
					<ul>
						<li>Closed several loopholes that could cause more requests than desired to Tesla's servers. A new, more comprehensive, mechanism was added to the underlying TeslaClient library to do this.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Known problems
					<ul>
						<li>When loading data for the Graphs tab the interface can become unresponsive for a few seconds if you are loading lots of data and have selected to display markers. This is a problem with JavaFX and I don't yet have a workaround.

								<li>Graphs can now be drawn with markers (dots) corresponding to every actual reading. Thin, semitransparent lines connect the dots for clarity, but do not represent readings. They represent the trendline between readings. Please refer to the documentation to learn how to select whether dots, lines, or both should be displayed.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Fixed</b>: The app used to throw away intermediate duplicate values in a sequence of readings. For example, if the Voltage reading was the same 10 times in a row, it would only store the first and last of those ten duplicate readings. This lead to odd looking graphs in isolated cases and made it impossible to show markers where the actual readings took place, or gaps in the collection of data.

						<li>Completely reworked the way statistics are stored. The new mechanism is compatible with older data files but stores the data in a manner that allows all data points to be maintained while not significantly increasing storage requirements. The ".aux" file is no longer required and will not be created by the application.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Known problems
					<ul>
						<li>The context menu in the Graphs tab should only ever show one checked item at a time. Occasionally it will show a check mark next to both the currently selected value and the last selected value. Moving your mouse over the last selected value will make it refresh and display correctly. The application functions properly, but the display can be confusing. This appears to be a problem with the underlying JavaFX system. I am looking for a workaround.

								<li>Sleep-Related
								</li>
								<li style="list-style: none">
									<ul>
										<li>Added an "Allow Sleep" item to the file menu. If selected, this will allow the app to go to sleep after 15 minutes of user inactivity. It will not collect data from the car and will allow the car to go to sleep. The setting of "Allow Sleep" is remembered between runs of the app. Any interaction with the app (e.g. selecting a new Tab) will cause an interaction with the car and will wake it from sleep.
										</li>
										<li>If the app goes into idle mode, it will display an indication in the title bar.
										</li>
										<li>When VisibleTesla is launched and immediately after the user logs in, it checks to see whether the car is asleep (Tesla firmware 5.0 and later). If it is asleep, a dialog will be displayed that asks the user whether she wants to wake it up. If the user says no, the app will exit. <b>NOTE</b>: This functioanlity has only been tested in simulation and should be considered experimental.

									<b>Fixed</b>: Problem where cached odometer readings showed incorrectly if the car's units are set to metric.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>HVAC
						</li>
						<li>Location
							<ul>
								<li>Overhauled the way map positioning is done. The map will now keep the car centered <i>unless the user explicitly pans the map</i>. If the user does so, she is indicating that she wants to view a specific location and the app will not recenter the map as the car moves. The user may always get back to "center-on-car" mode by clicking on the car. That will recenter the map, enter "center-on-car" mode, and show the address nearest the car in a popup info window.
								</li>
								<li>If the user pans the map manually thereby leaving "center-on-car" mode, the car may eventually drive off the edge of the map. VisibleTesla doesn't allow that to happen. Instead it repositions the map slightly to keep the car just at the edge so at least part of it is visible.
								</li>
								<li>The contents of the info window will become stale as the car moves. To refresh it, simply close it and open it again.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Fixed</b>: When you click on the arrow that represents the car, an infowindow pops up that gives the nearest street address to the car's location. That was never being updated. It always reflected the car's location when the map was first displayed.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Charge
							<ul>
								<li>Changed the "Fast Charger" table entry to "Supercharger". This entry is true only for Superchargers, not HPWCs.
								</li>
								<li>The Start and Stop buttons are only enabled if there is power connected to the car.
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Graphs
							<ul>
								<li>Added two new variables: speed and power.
								</li>
								<li>Experimenting with auto-adjustments to the refresh interval. It will drop down to as little as 20 seconds if at least one variable is changing 20% or more from reading to reading. It will go up as high as 5 minutes if there are no changes to any variables. It starts at 2 minutes.
								</li>
								<li>The app remembers which variables you had turned on / off between runs. For example, say you start the app, deselect Voltage, then quit the app. Next time you launch, it will remember that it shouldn't display Voltage. All variables are collected whether they are selected or not.
								</li>
								<li>Added a "reset" button in the lower left corner which is represented by a backward arrow icon. Clicking the button will recenter the chart with the current time at the center. This can be useful if you scroll way out and loose track of where you are in the chart.
								</li>
								<li>The scrolling and zooming behavior now work in both time (x axis) and value (y axis). With no modifier keys pressed, scrolling/zooming are constrained to the time axis. To scroll/zoom the value axis, press the CTRL key while operating the mouse. To scroll/zoom both, press the SHIFT key while operating the mouse.
								</li>
								<li>Zooming is now relative to the current mouse position. The point under the mouse will stay fixed, and the chart will zoom around it. It used to zoom relative to the center of the chart which could be disconcerting at times.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Fixed</b>: The app did not respect the units that are selected in the car's interface. Now it does.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Fixed</b>: There used to be a "dead area" where the dropdown list of items displayed. The mouse was non-responsive in that area. This problem has been fixed.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Fixed</b>: Scaling the chart to longer time frames could make it easy to lose your place in the chart. It now stays centered around the selected time frame.
