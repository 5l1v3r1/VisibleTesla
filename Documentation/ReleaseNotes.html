		User-Visible Changes
		<ul>
			<li>
				General
				<ul>
					<li>Automatically switch to the Overview tab after a successful login</li>
					<li>Change the auto-refresh time to 20 seconds</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Login
				<ul>
					<li>Enable the logout functionality.</li>
					<li>Add a "Remember Me" checkbox to the login panel. If this is not set, no cookies will be saved and the user must log in each time.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Overview
				<ul>
					<li>Cache the odometer reading so something reasonable shows until a new reading is received.</li>
					<li>Update the wheel view before the panel is displayed the first time.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				HVAC
				<ul>
					<li>Update the wheel view before the panel is displayed the first time.</li>
					<li>When no temp readings are available it used to show zero degrees. It now displays "â€¦".</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Graphs
				<ul>
					<li>Adding experimental support for graphing certain statistics.</li>
					<li>Please refer to the documentation for an overview.</li>
					<li>The stats that are currently gathered are somewhat arbitrary. They are all
						charge-related. I will update the set of stats that are gathered over time
						based on what is of interest and practical to gather.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Under-the-covers
		<ul>
			<li>Code Refactoring to support the graphs tab.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Known problems
		<ul>
			<li>There is a "dead area" on the chart where the Items dropdown list displays. Even when the Items list
				is not showing, mouse activity in that area is ignored. For example, if you try to mousedown and
				drag the chart, it will not respond.</li>
			<li>The x-axis in the graph does not always reliably display dates - just times.</li>
			<li>It has been reported that the app has trouble starting up on a car that is asleep with firmware 5.0.</li>

<h3>VisibleTesla 0.17c</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		User-Visible Changes
		<ul>
			<li>
				General
				<ul>
					<li>Several minor UI elements have been updated. Some ToggleButtons were changed to regular buttons. They no longer indicate state. They are just commands.</li>
					<li>The documentation has been updated with new screen captures to reflect the UI changes. Explanations have been added for the elements of the Charge Tab.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Login
				<ul>
			      <li>Fixed a problem handling passwords with certain special characters.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Overview
				<ul>
					<li>Fixes to the spoiler support. Get rid of "floaters" reported by @araxara. Move the spoiler to reflect the actual position on the car as opposed to where the iPhone app shows it.</li>
					<li>the car's elements (eg wheel type, odometer reading, door state) still update as data becomes available, but the spinner should remain spinning until all data becomes available.</li>

				Overview
				<ul>
    <li>The app never used to display the spoiler on cars that had it. I've implemented experimental support for that. Since my car doesn't have a spoiler, I was only able to test through simulation. If you have a spoiler on your Model S, please give it a try. If possible, try it with your trunk open and closed and let me know if you have problems or notice anomalies. [Thanks @araxara for reminding me about this]</li>
    <li>The details dialog in the Overview tab now lists the firmware version of the vehicle.</li>
    <li>If your car has a black roof you may have noticed that the app displayed it as a solid body color. This should be fixed. Since I don't have this configuration, I'd appreciate some testing from someone who does. [Thanks to @JohnQ for point this out]</li>
    <li>The controls for the panoramic roof (open, close, vent) used to be toggle buttons, now they are just regular buttons. This fits better with what they actually do and how they work.</li>

			<li>
				General
				<ul>
					<li>Basic documentation has been added. Click Overview.html in the Documentation folder.</li>
    				<li>There were cases where auto refreshes never happened. They were scheduled for 300M years into the future rather than 15 seconds. That's fixed.</li>

			<li>
				Overview
				<ul>
				    <li>Improved the odometer implementation. It now updates in the background properly - no refresh is necessary. The odometer is not updated during auto-refreshes, but is updated upon explicit refreshes via the refresh button</li>
				    <li>There is now a "Details" button on the Overview tab. Pressing it pops up a dialog with a simple scrolling list of detailed data about the current vehicle.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				HVAC
				<ul>
    				<li>Started to fix the "wrong wheel" problem on the HVAC page. The driver-side wheels are now reflected properly, but not the passenger side wheels. I don't have a good plan for how to deal with the passenger side.</li>

				Overview
				<ul>
    				<li>A first cut at displaying the odometer reading on the Overview tab. It does respect the GUI units setting. This is not the final implementation but I wanted to get something out there. It has several limitations:</li>
    				<ul>
				    	<li>It usually requires a refresh before the odometer reading is displayed. In the future it will simply show up when a separate background task completes.</li>
      					<li>Once displayed, it does not update if the vehicle is in motion.</li>
