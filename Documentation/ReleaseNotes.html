                            <li>Add three new commands: "Charge: Low", "Charge: Std", and "Charge: Max". These set the charge target for your Tesla. If you use "Charge: Max" or "Charge: Std" it will set the charge limit to these predefined set points. "Charge: Low" will default to the car's notion of minimum (50% these days), but you can set it to whatever value you'd like in the Scheduler preferences. See below.</li>

                            <li>The Scheduler preferences now contain an option that allows you to set the value for "Charge: Low". By default this is set to the car's notion of minimum charging level. You can use the slider to set it to some other value.</li>

        <p><strong>Special Notice</strong>: This version changes the folder in which VisibleTesla stores its data files by default. If you are using VisibleTesla for the first time, you can ignore this. For existing users, please note that the stats file and the cookies file will be moved from within the app folder to a location within your user folder. See below for details. The best way to have a smooth transition is to follow these steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>You must manually copy these files from your previous version of VisibleTesla to the newly installed version just as you have always had to do. This is the last time you'll need to do that.</li>
                <li>Start VisibleTesla, let it load completely, then quit and restart it. Technically this is not necessary, but it is somewhat safer to do so.</li>

                            <li>Updating to new versions will no longer requires manually moving the stats file and cookies file form the existing app folder to the new folder. NOTE: You must still do this when upgrading to verion 0.21.02, but will not have to do it for future versions.</li>

                            <li><strong>Fixed</strong>: Correctly remember and display the "Remember Me" selection between runs. Unchecking the "Remember Me" deletes the cookies file from your system and will force you to log in manually the next time the app starts.</li>
                            <li>Try harder to wake up a sleeping Tesla when asked to do so.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Various changes to reduce the memory consumption and increase the performance of the Graphs tab. The changes result in slight visual differences from earlier versions. <ul>
                                <li>The first change comes in the way that markers are drawn. I do it manually now as opposed to letting the underlying graphics library do it for me.</li>
                                <li>The second change has to do with sampling. If you are zoomed out and consequently displaying a lot of data, many of the points may be right on top of one another. For example, if you are showing a month's worth of data, you can't possibly see separate data points that were taken 30 seconds apart. They'll fall right on top of each other on the screen. Rather than draw all of those overlapping data points, I only draw one. As you zoom in, you'll see a single data point resolve into multiple data points.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>General Preferences: Added an Advanced option that allows the user to select where to store internal application files. In general users should not change this setting. It is provided for power users and to maintain compatibility with older versions. The default setting will cause these application internal files to be stored in a location appropriate to the platform. This location differs between Mac, Linux, and Windows. You can determine this location by clicking the "Show" button in the General preferences panel.</li>
                            <li>Graphs Preferences: Split into Basic and Advanced preferences. Added an Advanced preference that lets users select whether data should be loaded into the graph incrementally or all at once. Incrementally is the current behavior and default. Loading the data all at once is faster, but the app becomes unresponsive while loading.</li>

                            <li>Added "Check for Updates" functionality. This is the first step towards auto update. When the app launches it will check the web for a newer version. If there is one, a dialog box will be displayed with a download link and a link to the new release notes. It will only do this once per week. If you want to check for a newer version earlier than that, use the "Help->Check For Updates" menu item.</li>
                            <li>Additional error handling if VisibleTesla is unable to communicate with the car. For example, if the car is sleeping and can't be awoken.</li>
                            <li>Fixes to a few edge cases in the way inactivity is handled.</li>
                            <li>Updated the look of dialog boxes to be more native to the platorm (Windows, Mac, Linux) than they used to be. This primarily affects the window borders and controls. The content of the dialog boxes remains the same.</li>

                            <li>Several new vehicle options are now recognized and will be displayed in the Details dialog. These include things like the Cold Weather Package, the Parking Sensor option, the Lighting package, and the Security Package.</li>

                            <li><strong>Experimental</strong> support for streaming updates to the map location. In this version the location of the marker will update in near-real-time as the car is moving. The frequency of updates is a maximum of 4 times/second, but may not be at that rate. There may be times when Tesla's servers do not stream at that rate or network delays slow down the updates. It will continue to auto-refresh every 20 seconds as usual.

                            <li>More work to overcome limitations in the underlying graphing library. Statistics are now loaded in the background starting from the present time and working backwards to the oldest statistics. This allows the suer to see and start interacting with the most recent data in the graph right away.</li>
                            <li>While loading the Graphs tab now displays a two-part progress bar along the bottom of the tab. The first part of the progress bar represents the progress in loading the visible series. Those are the series that are selected in the "Show Items" drop down list. Visible series are loaded first. The second part of the progress bar represents the progress in loading the currently hidden series. The size of these two parts are proportional to the number of hidden and visible series. For example, if 4 of the 8 possible series are visible, then the two parts of the progress bar will be the same size. If 2 of the 8 are visible, then the first part will be a quarter of the total size and the second part will be three quarters.</li>
                            <li>The goal of all of this is to make the Graphs tab provide useful information as quickly as possible while loading all other data in the background.<li>

                    <li>Changes to the JavaFX LineChart and XYChart classes for better performance. This is achieved through subclassing, not changes to the core library.</li>
                    <li>Fairly major changes to the code to work around graphics performance issues - at least to make performance tolerable for "large" datasets.</li>
                    <li>Forked the javafx-dialogs code to add the ability to get a more native look on each platform. Updated the README.md file to reflect where to download my forked version. Trying to figure out how to get it integrated into the main repository.</li>

                    <li>The context menu in the Graphs tab should only ever show one checked item at a time. Occasionally it will show a check mark next to both the currently selected value and the last selected value. This appears to be fixed with the latest version of Java (1.7u45). This version is <strong>not</strong> recommended for developers, but seems to be fine for users.

                User-Visible Changes
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        General
                        <ul>
                            <li>Added experimental support for multiple vehicles on the same account. When you log in, VisbleTesla will determine whether there are multiple vehicles on your account. If there are, you're a lucky devil! In this case you will be prompted to select which vehicle you want to use. There is currently no way to change the selection without restarting the app. Since I don't have more than one Tesla, I have not been able to test this.</li>
                            <li>The auto-refresh time is now 30 seconds instead of 20 seconds.</li>
                            <li>Pressing the refresh button repeatedly in rapid succession will <strong>not</strong> invoke the refresh function over and over. Rapid repeated presses will be ignored so a backlog of requests won't build up. This is true for all tabs.</li>
                            <li>
                                The Menu structure has been modified. The 3 top level menus are:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>File: contains "Export Graph Data..." and "Close".</li>
                                    <li>Options: contains two submenus - "Inactivity Mode" and "Simulate".</li>
                                    <li>Help: contains "About", "Documentation", and "What's new".</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>The "Allow Sleeping" menu item is now part of the Inactivity submenu of the options menu. The Inactivity submenu contians three mutually exclusive options - if you select one option, the previously selected option will be deselected. The options are "Allow Sleeping", "Allow Daydreaming", and "Stay Awake". "Allow Sleeping" acts just as before. When "Allow Daydreaming" is selected it tells the app to stop auto-refreshing after 15 minutes of inactivity. The scheduler will continue to run and the Graphs Tab will continue to collect data. Your vehicle will not be able to go to sleep in this mode, but the load on Tesla's servers is reduced. By default, this menu item is selected. When "Stay Awake" is selected the app will not sleep or daydream. VisibleTesla remembers which of these three choices you have selected even if you quit and restart. </li>
                            <li><strong>Fixed</strong>: A new type of seat has been added to the list. This only shows up in the "Details" display from the Overview tab. The seat type hadn't been seen before. It is "Perf Leather with Grey Piping, White". The  code that Tesla uses for this is IZZW.

                        Overview
                        <ul>
                            <li>The odometer reading is only available through the streaming API. In some cases this can require several requests to Tesla's servers to retreive. Since even at 60 mph the reading doesn't change much every minute, the app no longer updates the reading on every refresh. If the user presses the refresh button, it will force a new reading. Otherwise it is updated on every third auto-refresh.</li>
                            <li>At the very bottom of the details dialog (presented when you press the Details button), there is a new item called "Low level information". It is one very long line of detailed information that is only of use for debugging or for the technically curious. This same line of information is written to the tesla.log file when the application starts.

                        <ul>
                            <li>Based on user feedback, I have modified the way lines are displayed in the graph. If you have chosen to display both lines and markers, the lines will display as thin and semi-transparent. This is the same as version 0.20.00. If you choose to display only the lines  (no markers) then the lines will be displayed thicker and solid.
                            </li>
                            <li>Loading a graph with many data points and a display mode that includes Markers (not just lines) can take a long time. The progress spinner is now displayed during this period as well as a "Loading" message.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li>There are three new commands available to the scheduler: "Awake", "Sleep", and "Daydream". When one of these is executed, it is equivalent to the user selecting "Stay Awake", "Allow Sleeping", or "Allow Daydreaming" from the "Options->Inactivity Mode" menu. This can be used, for example, to tell the app to sleep at night and daydream during the day. Note that executing one of these commands simply causes the app to enter the associated inactivity mode. The app must still be idle for 15 minutes before it will sleep or daydream.</li>

                            <li>Graphs can now be drawn with markers (dots) corresponding to every actual reading. Thin, semitransparent lines connect the dots for clarity, but do not represent readings. They represent the trendline between readings. Please refer to the documentation to learn how to select whether dots, lines, or both should be displayed.
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Fixed</b>: The app used to throw away intermediate duplicate values in a sequence of readings. For example, if the Voltage reading was the same 10 times in a row, it would only store the first and last of those ten duplicate readings. This lead to odd looking graphs in isolated cases and made it impossible to show markers where the actual readings took place, or gaps in the collection of data.</li>

It will not collect data from the car and will allow the car to go to sleep. The setting of "Allow Sleep" is remembered between runs of the app. Any interaction with the app (e.g. selecting a new Tab) will cause an interaction with the car and will wake it from sleep.

                        Location
                        <ul>
                            <li>Overhauled the way map positioning is done. The map will now keep the car centered <i>unless the user explicitly pans the map</i>. If the user does so, she is indicating that she wants to view a specific location and the app will not recenter the map as the car moves. The user may always get back to "center-on-car" mode by clicking on the car. That will recenter the map, enter "center-on-car" mode, and show the address nearest the car in a popup info window.</li>
                            <li>If the user pans the map manually thereby leaving "center-on-car" mode, the car may eventually drive off the edge of the map. VisibleTesla doesn't allow that to happen. Instead it repositions the map slightly to keep the car just at the edge so at least part of it is visible.</li>
                            <li>The contents of the info window will become stale as the car moves. To refresh it, simply close it and open it again.</li>
                            <li><b>Fixed</b>: When you click on the arrow that represents the car, an infowindow pops up that gives the nearest street address to the car's location. That was never being updated. It always reflected the car's location when the map was first displayed.

                            <li>Added two new variables: speed and power.</li>
                            <li>Experimenting with auto-adjustments to the refresh interval. It will drop down to as little as 20 seconds if at least one variable is changing 20% or more from reading to reading. It will go up as high as 5 minutes if there are no changes to any variables. It starts at 2 minutes.</li>
                            <li>The app remembers which variables you had turned on / off between runs. For example, say you start the app, deselect Voltage, then quit the app. Next time you launch, it will remember that it shouldn't display Voltage. All variables are collected whether they are selected or not.</li>
                            <li>Added a "reset" button in the lower left corner which is represented by a backward arrow icon. Clicking the  button will recenter the chart with the current time at the center. This can be useful if you scroll way out and loose track of where you are in the chart.</li>
                            <li>The scrolling and zooming behavior now work in both time (x axis) and value (y axis). With no modifier keys pressed, scrolling/zooming are constrained to the time axis. To scroll/zoom the value axis, press the CTRL key while operating the mouse. To scroll/zoom both, press the SHIFT key while operating the mouse. </li>
                            <li>Zooming is now relative to the current mouse position. The point under the mouse will stay fixed, and the chart will zoom around it. It used to zoom relative to the center of the chart which could be disconcerting at times.</li>
                            <li><b>Fixed</b>: The app  did not respect the units that are selected in the car's interface. Now it does.</li>
                            <li><b>Fixed</b>: There used to be a "dead area" where the dropdown list of items displayed. The mouse was non-responsive in that area. This problem has been fixed.</li>
                            <li><b>Fixed</b>: Scaling the chart to longer time frames could make it easy to lose your place in the chart. It now stays centered around the selected time frame.</li>

                    <li>There is a "dead area" on the chart where the Items dropdown list displays. Even when the Items list
                        is not showing, mouse activity in that area is ignored. For example, if you try to mousedown and
                        drag the chart, it will not respond.
                    </li>
                    <li>The x-axis in the graph does not always reliably display dates - just times.</li>

                            <li>The app never used to display the spoiler on cars that had it. I've implemented experimental support for that. Since my car doesn't have a spoiler, I was only able to test through simulation. If you have a spoiler on your Model S, please give it a try. If possible, try it with your trunk open and closed and let me know if you have problems or notice anomalies. [Thanks @araxara for reminding me about this]</li>
                            <li>The details dialog in the Overview tab now lists the firmware version of the vehicle.</li>
                            <li>If your car has a black roof you may have noticed that the app displayed it as a solid body color. This should be fixed. Since I don't have this configuration, I'd appreciate some testing from someone who does. [Thanks to @JohnQ for point this out]</li>
                            <li>The controls for the panoramic roof (open, close, vent) used to be toggle buttons, now they are just regular buttons. This fits better with what they actually do and how they work.</li>
