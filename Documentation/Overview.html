    <h1>VisibleTesla</h1>
    <p>VisibleTesla lets you view, monitor, and control your
    Tesla Model S in much the same way as the official Tesla iPhone and Android
    apps do. Unlike those apps, VisibleTesla is not official, not from Tesla,
    and not supported.</p>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Be careful</em> when using this software as it can
    lock and unlock your car as well as control various functions relating to
    the charging system, sun roof, lights, horn, and other subsystems of the
    car. Don't to send your login and password to anyone other than Tesla or
    you are giving away the authentication details required to control your
    car. VisibleTesla does not store your password and only communicates with
    Tesla.</p>

    <p>Use this application at your own risk. The authors do not guarantee its
    proper functioning. This application attempts to use the same interfaces
    used by the official Tesla apps. However, it is possible that use of this
    application may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are
    responsible. Use of this application can change the settings on your car
    and may have negative consequences such as (but not limited to) unlocking
    the doors, opening the sun roof, or reducing the available charge in the
    battery.</p>

    <h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Introduction</a></h1>The app
    has a tabbed interface with one tab per functional area. When you launch
    you start out in a login tab and the other tabs are disabled until you log
    in. If you've logged in before then it automatically logs you in again
    based on stored cookies. This screenshot shows the logged-in state:

    <p><img alt="Login Tab" border="0" src="images/01_Login_Tab.png" /></p>

    <p>The Overview tab shows basic state about the vehicle and gives access to
    commands like lock/unlock, operating the panoramic roof (if you have one),
    flashing the lights, etc. These screen shots show the overview tab
    reflecting various states of the car. The roof was vented using the "Vent"
    button.</p>

    <img border="0" src="images/04_Overview_Door_Open.png" />
    </p>

    <p>Next we have the HVAC tab which shows the state of that system. It also
    allows you to set the target temperature and turn on/off the system.</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/05_HVAC_Tab.png" /></p>

    <p>The location tab embeds a Google map to show the current location and
    the marker is rotated to show the current heading. There is a "Browse"
    button that will launch a browser displaying a Google map with the car's
    location so you can get directions, etc.</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/06_Location_Tab.png" /></p>

    <p>The last tab shows the charge state and allows you to set the charge
    target (max or std) and start/stop charging. The screen shots show the car
    when not connected to a charger, connected but not charging, and charging.
    In this case it is connected to an HPWC which is still limited to 60A.</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/07_Charge_Tab.png" />
    <img border="0" src="images/08_Charge_Plugged_In.png" />
    <img border="0" src="images/09_Charging.png" /></p>

    <p>This screen shot shows the "spinner" that is displayed when the app is
    communicating with the vehicle. Each tab has a refresh button and the app
    auto-refreshes once 15 seconds have elapsed since the last manual or
    automatic refresh. Switching tabs does an auto refresh on the newly
    selected tab.</p>

    <p><img border="0" src="images/12_Auto_Refresh.png" /></p>

    <p>Finally, I added a simulation menu so I could look at vehicle
    configurations other than my own. These screen shots show changing the
    color to red and using dark rims. I don't have images for every possible
    configuration including the 19" wheels which I happen to have.</p>

    <h2><a id="installation" name="installation">Installing and Running</a></h1>This
    application has been installed and run on several variations of Windows 7
    &amp; 8, 32 and 64 bit. It was developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.8 and
    has been installed and run on several variants of Mac OS including 10.9
    beta. As far as I know, it has not been tested on Linux, though it should
    run there as well.

    <h3>Java</h2>VisibleTesla is a Java application and requires that you have
    a recent version of Java installed on your system. If you already have Java
    installed, you can skip this step. You can download Java for Windows, Mac,
    and Linux from java.com using the links below:
    <ul>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.xml">Windows</a> </li>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml">Mac</a> </li>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.xml">Linux</a> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be careful when installing Java for Windows. It may ask you to install
    other software from partners. You do not need this software to run
    VisibleTesla and may safely decline the installation.</p>

    <h3>Running VisibleTesla</h2>
    If you haven't already done so, find the VisibleTesla zip file that you downloaded and extract the contents.
    It will contain a single folder named something like "VisibleTesla 0.14". Within that folder you will find a file
    named VisibleTesla.jar. This is the application. Simply double click on VisibleTesla.jar and the app will begin
    running. If it doesn't, you may not have a recent version of Java installed. Please look at the 
    <a href="#installation">installation notes</a>.
