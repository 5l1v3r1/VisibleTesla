    <h1>VisibleTesla</h1>
    <p>VisibleTesla lets you view, monitor, and control your
    Tesla Model S in much the same way as the official Tesla iPhone and Android
    apps do. Unlike those apps, VisibleTesla is not official, not from Tesla,
    and not supported.</p>

    <p>VisibleTesla is free for personal and non-commercial use. It is based on
    the work of many members of the <a href="http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/forum.php">
    Tesla Motors Club Forum</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Be careful</em> when using this software as it can
    lock and unlock your car as well as control various functions relating to
    the charging system, sun roof, lights, horn, and other subsystems of the
    car. Don't to send your login and password to anyone other than Tesla or
    you are giving away the authentication details required to control your
    car. VisibleTesla does not store your password and only communicates with
    Tesla.</p>

    <p>Use this application at your own risk. The authors do not guarantee its
    proper functioning. This application attempts to use the same interfaces
    used by the official Tesla apps. However, it is possible that use of this
    application may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are
    responsible. Use of this application can change the settings on your car
    and may have negative consequences such as (but not limited to) unlocking
    the doors, opening the sun roof, or reducing the available charge in the
    battery.</p>

    <h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Overview</a></h2>VisibleTesla
    has a tabbed interface with one tab per functional area. The following sections
    describe each of the tabs. The screenshots are representative and may not
    reflect exactly what you'll see. For example, these screen shots were taken on a Mac.</p>

    <h3><a id="login_tab">Login Tab</a></h3>
    When you launch the app
    you'll start out in a login tab. The other tabs will be disabled until you log
    in. If you've logged in before then the app will automatically log you in again
    based on stored cookies. This screenshot shows the logged-in state:

    <p><img alt="Login Tab" border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/01_Login_Tab.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="overview_tab">Overview Tab</a></h3>

    <p>The Overview tab shows basic state about the vehicle and gives access to
    commands like lock/unlock, operating the panoramic roof (if you have one),
    flashing the lights, etc.These screen shots show the overview tab
    reflecting various states of the car. The second screen shows an
    information dialog that gives details about your car.
    </p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/02_Overview_Tab.png" /></p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/02a_Overview_Details.png" /></p>
    <p>The next screen shot shows the panoramic roof in the vented state. The user
        vented the roof by pressing the Vent button. The next screenshot shows
        wht the app will display when the driver's door is open.<p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/03_Overview_Vented.png" /></p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/04_Overview_Door_Open.png" /> </p>
    
    <h3><a id="hvac_tab">HVAC Tab</a></h3>

    <p>Next we have the HVAC tab which shows the state of that system. It also
    allows you to set the target temperature and turn on/off the system.</p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/05_HVAC_Tab.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="location_tab">Location Tab</a></h3>

    <p>The location tab embeds a Google map to show the current location and
    the marker is rotated to show the current heading. There is a "Browse"
    button that will launch a browser displaying a Google map with the car's
    location so you can get directions or perform any other Google map function.</p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/06_Location_Tab.png" /></p>
    <p>Like a normal Google Map, you can zoom in and out, you can pan, and switch to satellite
        mode. If you click on the arrow representing your Tesla, an info window will pop
        up displaying the street address that is closest to your car.</p>
        <p><b>Note:</b> If you pan the map such that the marker for your car is no longer
            displayed, the map will automatically pan back upon the next refresh.</p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/06a_Location_Info.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="charging_tab">Charge Tab</a></h3>

    <p>The Charge tab shows the charge state and allows you to set the charge
    target and to start/stop charging. The slider allows you to specify how much
    charge you want the car to get. You can click on "Standard" or "Max" to
    make the slider jump to a preset value.</p>

    <p><b>Notes:</b><ul>
        <li>VisibleTesla checks the version of firmware installed on your
        car. If it is an older version, the slider capability is not supported
        and you can only adjust the charge target by clicking on "Standard" or "Max".</li>
        <li>The range of the slider is automatically adjusted to accommodate the range of
            values that the car will accept. For example, the minimum value may be 50 rather
            than 0.</li>
            <li>The Tesla server may adjust the value you specify. The actual value
                will be reflected in the slider. you may see it jump to a slightly
                different value after you release it.</li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    The screen shots show the car
    when not connected to a charger, connected but not charging, and charging.
    In this case it is connected to an HPWC which is set to 60A.</p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/07_Charge_Tab.png" />
    <img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/08_Charge_Plugged_In.png" />
    <img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/09_Charging.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="autorefresh">Auto-Refresh</a></h3>
    <p>This screen shot shows the "spinner" that is displayed when the app is
    communicating with the vehicle. Each tab has a refresh button and the app
    auto-refreshes once 15 seconds have elapsed since the last manual or
    automatic refresh. Switching tabs automatically refreshes the newly
    selected tab.</p>
    <p>
        In order to ensure that Tesla's servers do not become overloaded, the app
        automatically monitors the rate at which it makes requests. If you manually press
        refresh multiple times in rapid succession, you may find that the spinner rotates
        for a longer than usual. The app is automatically slowing down its requests to Tesla's
        servers in order to remain a good citizen.
    </p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/12_Auto_Refresh.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="simulation">Simulation Menu</a></h3>

    <p>The simulation menu allows you to look at car configurations other than your own.
        These screen shots show changing the
    color to red and using 21" dark rims.</p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/10_Simulate_Color_Red.png" />
    <img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/11_Simulate_Dark_Rims.png" /></p>

    <hr>
    <h2><a id="installation" name="installation">Installing and Running</a></h2>This
    application has been installed and run on several variations of Windows 7
    &amp; 8, 32 and 64 bit. It was developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.8 and
    has been installed and run on several variants of Mac OS including 10.9
    beta. I've done very limited testing on Linux (Mint 15 in particular) and
    did not notice any problems.

    <h3><a id="java">Java</a></h3>
    VisibleTesla is a Java application and requires that you have
    a recent version of Java installed on your system. If you already have Java
    installed, you can skip this step. You can download Java for Windows, Mac,
    and Linux from java.com using the links below:
    <ul>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.xml">Windows</a> </li>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml">Mac</a> </li>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.xml">Linux</a> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be careful when installing Java for Windows. It may ask you to install
    other software from partners. You do not need this software to run
    VisibleTesla and may safely decline the installation.</p>

    <h3><a id="running">Running VisibleTesla</a></h3>
    If you haven't already done so, find the VisibleTesla zip file that you downloaded and extract the contents.
    It will contain a single folder named something like "VisibleTesla 0.14". Within that folder you will find a file
    named VisibleTesla.jar. This is the application. Simply double click on VisibleTesla.jar and the app will begin
    running. If it doesn't, you may not have a recent version of Java installed. Please look at the 
    <a href="#installation">installation notes</a>.
