    <h1>VisibleTesla</h1>
    <p>VisibleTesla lets you view, monitor, and control your
    Tesla Model S in much the same way as the official Tesla iPhone and Android
    apps do. Unlike those apps, VisibleTesla is not official, not from Tesla,
    and not supported.</p>

    <p>VisibleTesla is free for personal and non-commercial use. It is based on
    the work of many members of the <a href="http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/forum.php">
    Tesla Motors Club Forum</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> <em>Be careful</em> when using this software as it can
    lock and unlock your car as well as control various functions relating to
    the charging system, sun roof, lights, horn, and other subsystems of the
    car. Don't to send your login and password to anyone other than Tesla or
    you are giving away the authentication details required to control your
    car. VisibleTesla does not store your password and only communicates with
    Tesla.</p>

    <p>Use this application at your own risk. The authors do not guarantee its
    proper functioning. This application attempts to use the same interfaces
    used by the official Tesla apps. However, it is possible that use of this
    application may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are
    responsible. Use of this application can change the settings on your car
    and may have negative consequences such as (but not limited to) unlocking
    the doors, opening the sun roof, or reducing the available charge in the
    battery.</p>

    <h2><a id="introduction" name="introduction">Overview</a></h2>VisibleTesla
    has a tabbed interface with one tab per functional area. The following sections
    describe each of the tabs. The screenshots are representative and may not
    reflect exactly what you'll see. For example, these screen shots were taken on a Mac.</p>

    <p>The app has three menus: File, Simulate, and Help. The items of the first two menus will be described below. The Help menu allows you to bring up this documentation, the release notes, and a general "About" dialog.</p>

    <h3><a id="login_tab">Login Tab</a></h3>
    When you launch the app
    you'll start out in a login tab. The other tabs will be disabled until you log
    in. The first time you use the app you'll need to enter the same username and
    password you use with the iPhone or Android app. If you'd like the app to remember
    you so you won't have to re-enter your details every time, check the "Remember Me" box
    before clocking the "Login" button. On subsequent runs of the app, you won't need
    to enter your credentials.</p> 

    Notes:<ul>
        <li>Even if you use the "Remember Me" feature, your username and password will not
        be stored on your computer. Instead, the app will store "cookies" which contain
        encoded information from Tesla. The cookies are stored in a file called cookies.txt.
        You should not share that file with others. Even though it does not contain your password,
        it can be used by others to connect to your car.</li>
        <li>If you don't want a cookies file to be created, don't check the "Remember Me" box. It is also
            perfectly fine to delete the cookies.txt file.
        <li>All communication between the app and Tesla are encrypted including the login
            process.</li>
            <li>If you logout of the application, you'll need to re-enter your credentials to use
        the app again.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The following screenshot shows the logged-in state:</P>

    <p><img alt="Login Tab" border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/01_Login_Tab.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="overview_tab">Overview Tab</a></h3>

    <p>The Overview tab shows basic state about the vehicle and gives access to
    commands like lock/unlock, operating the panoramic roof (if you have one),
    flashing the lights, etc.These screen shots show the overview tab
    reflecting various states of the car. The second screen shows an
    information dialog that gives details about your car.
    </p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/02_Overview_Tab.png" /></p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/02a_Overview_Details.png" /></p>
    <p>The next screen shot shows the panoramic roof in the vented state. The user
        vented the roof by pressing the Vent button. The next screenshot shows
        wht the app will display when the driver's door is open.<p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/03_Overview_Vented.png" /></p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/04_Overview_Door_Open.png" /> </p>
    
    <h3><a id="hvac_tab">HVAC Tab</a></h3>

    <p>Next we have the HVAC tab which shows the state of that system. It also
    allows you to set the target temperature and turn on/off the system.</p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/05_HVAC_Tab.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="location_tab">Location Tab</a></h3>

    <p>The location tab embeds a Google map to show the current location and
    the marker is rotated to show the current heading. There is a "Browse"
    button that will launch your default browser displaying a Google map with the car's
    location so you can get directions or perform any other Google map function.</p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/06_Location_Tab.png" /></p>
    <p>Like a normal Google Map, you can zoom in and out, you can pan, and switch to satellite
        mode. If you click on the arrow representing your Tesla, an info window will pop
        up displaying the street address that is closest to your car.</p>
    <p>The map will  keep the car centered <i>unless you manually pan the map</i>. If you do so, you are indicating that you want to view a specific location and the app will not recenter the map as the car moves. You may always get back to "center-on-car" mode by clicking on the car. That will recenter the map, enter "center-on-car" mode, and show the address nearest the car in a popup info window.</p>
                        <p>If the user pans the map manually thereby leaving "center-on-car" mode, the car may eventually drive off the edge of the map. VisibleTesla doesn't allow that to happen. Instead it repositions the map slightly to keep the car just at the edge so at least part of it is visible.</p>
    <p><b>Note</b>: The contents of the info window will become stale as the car moves. To refresh it, simply close it and open it again.</p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/06a_Location_Info.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="charging_tab">Charge Tab</a></h3>

    <p>The Charge tab shows the charge state and allows you to set the charge
    target and to start/stop charging. The slider allows you to specify how much
    charge you want the car to get. You can click on "Standard" or "Max" to
    make the slider jump to a preset value.</p>

    <p><b>Notes:</b><ul>
        <li>VisibleTesla checks the version of firmware installed on your
        car. If it is an older version, the slider capability is not supported
        and you can only adjust the charge target by clicking on "Standard" or "Max".</li>
        <li>The range of the slider is automatically adjusted to accommodate the range of
            values that the car will accept. For example, the minimum value may be 50 rather
            than 0.</li>
            <li>The Tesla server may adjust the value you specify. The actual value
                will be reflected in the slider. you may see it jump to a slightly
                different value after you release it.</li>
            </ul>
    </p>

    <p>There are quite a few pieces of data in the Charge Tab. The following
        table lists the items and gives a brief description of what they represent.</p>

    <table class="grid_table">
        <tr>

    <p>The screen shots show the car
    when not connected to a charger, connected but not charging, and charging.
    In this case it is connected to an HPWC which is set to 60A.</p>

    <h3><a id="graphs_tab">Graphs Tab</a></h3>
    <p>This tab tracks and graphs basic statistics about the vehicle as a line chart. The x-axis represents the time at
        which the stats were gathered and the y-axis represents the values. An "Items" drop down list allows
        you to select which statistics are displayed. It also gives a color-coded legend to so you can tell
        which line represents which value. If you deselect a particular item it will not be displayed, but
        the statistics for that item will continue to be gathered.
    </p>
    <p>Note that hese statistics are only collected while VisibleTesla is running.
        If you quit the app or your computer goes into sleep mode, the statistics will
        not be collected until the next time you run the app. If you have selected "File->Allow Sleep" and you don't use the app for 15 minutes, it will stop collecting samples.
        VisibleTesla does store
        the statistics it collects. If you quit the app and restart it later, it will 
        display the old statistics and newly gathered ones.
    </p>
    <p>You can interact with the line chart in several different ways.
        <ul>
            <li>Panning: If you wish to move the view forwarward or backward in time, simply grab the chart (mouse-down) and drag it to the right or the left. To pan the chart up or down, press the CTRL button while dragging the mouse. If you want to pan in both directions simultaneously, hold the SHIFT key while dragging.</li>
            <li>Zooming: If you wish to  change the time-span that is displayed (zoom in on a small
            range of time or zoom out to a large range of time) spin the scroll-wheel on your mouse up or down. To zoom in or out on the value (y) axis, press CTRL while scrolling. To zoom both axes simultaneously, press SHIFT while scrolling. When zooming, the app does so relative to the current mouse location. That is, the chart will seem to expand around the point under the mouse.</li>
            <li>To select which statistics are displayed, click on the arrow to expand the Items dropdown.
                Select or deselect the statistics as desired.</li>
            <li>The app remembers which variables you have selected. For example, say you start the app, deselect Voltage, then quit the app. Next time you launch, it will remember that it shouldn't display Voltage. All variables are collected whether they are selected or not.</li>
            <li>In the lower left corner of the chart there is a reset button (backward pointing arrow icon). Clicking the  button will recenter the chart with the current time at the center. This can be useful if you scroll way out and loose track of where you are in the chart.</li>
            <li>To see more data at once, simply the grow the window. The graph will expand and scale to fit.</li>
            <li>To determine the specific value at any point in the graph, move your mouse over the spot to be
                measured. A readout in the upper left corner of the chart is updated to display the time and value
                corresponding to the location of the cursor.
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>The following screenshots show the graph with the Items dropdown expanded. The first chart shows all
        of the statistics displayed while the second shows the chart with two statistics de-selected.
    </p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/14_Graphs_All.png" /></p>
    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/13_Graphs_Partial.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="autorefresh">Auto-Refresh</a></h3>
    <p>This screen shot shows the "spinner" that is displayed when the app is
    communicating with the vehicle. Each tab has a refresh button and the app
    auto-refreshes once 15 seconds have elapsed since the last manual or
    automatic refresh. Switching tabs automatically refreshes the newly
    selected tab.</p>
    <p>
        In order to ensure that Tesla's servers do not become overloaded, the app
        automatically monitors the rate at which it makes requests. If you manually press
        refresh multiple times in rapid succession, you may find that the spinner rotates
        for a longer than usual. The app is automatically slowing down its requests to Tesla's
        servers in order to remain a good citizen.
    </p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/12_Auto_Refresh.png" /></p>

    <h3><a id="sleepmode">Sleep Mode</a></h3>
    If your car has version 5.0 or later firmware, it has a sleep mode which allows it to conserve power. When you connect to your car from VisibleTesla or one of Tesla's official apps, it will wake the car up if it is sleeping. You may want to avoid doing this accidentally, so when you log in to VisibleTesla, it determines whether the car is sleeping. If it is, you will be presented with a dialog asking if you want to wake up the car or let it sleep (see the screenshot below). If you click the "let it sleep" button, the app will exit without waking the car. Otherwise, the app will start normally.

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/15_Sleep_Dialog.png" /></p>

    When you are using VisibleTesla, it communicates with your car on a regular basis. This communication will keep your car from going to sleep. This may be exactly what you want, but often you'll want to let the car go to sleep even when VisibleTesla is running. To do this, use the File->Allow Sleep menu. When checked, "Allow Sleep" will cause the app to go into an idle mode after 15 minutes of inactivity. When in this mode the app will not interact with your car which means it can go to sleep. To let you know that it is in inacative mode, the app will display an indication in the title bar. If you want the app to start communicating with your car again, simply click the refresh button on any tab or switch tabs to cause a refresh.

    <h3><a id="simulation">Simulation Menu</a></h3>

    <p>The simulation menu allows you to look at car configurations other than your own.
        These screen shots show changing the
    color to red and using 21" dark rims.</p>

    <p><img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/10_Simulate_Color_Red.png" />
    <img border="0" style="margin:5px" src="images/11_Simulate_Dark_Rims.png" /></p>

    <hr>
    <h2><a id="installation" name="installation">Installing and Running</a></h2>This
    application has been installed and run on several variations of Windows 7
    &amp; 8, 32 and 64 bit. It was developed and tested on Mac OS X 10.8 and
    has been installed and run on several variants of Mac OS including 10.9
    beta. I've done very limited testing on Linux (Mint 15 in particular) and
    did not notice any problems.

    <h3><a id="java">Java</a></h3>
    VisibleTesla is a Java application and requires that you have
    a recent version of Java installed on your system. If you already have Java
    installed, you can skip this step. You can download Java for Windows, Mac,
    and Linux from java.com using the links below:
    <ul>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.xml">Windows</a> </li>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml">Mac</a> </li>
        <li> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.xml">Linux</a> </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Be careful when installing Java for Windows. It may ask you to install
    other software from partners. You do not need this software to run
    VisibleTesla and may safely decline the installation.</p>

    <h3><a id="running">Running VisibleTesla</a></h3>
    If you haven't already done so, find the VisibleTesla zip file that you downloaded and extract the contents.
    It will contain a single folder named something like "VisibleTesla 0.14". Within that folder you will find a file
    named VisibleTesla.jar. This is the application. Simply double click on VisibleTesla.jar and the app will begin
    running. If it doesn't, you may not have a recent version of Java installed. Please look at the 
    <a href="#installation">installation notes</a>.
