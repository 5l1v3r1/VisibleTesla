                The Preferences tab allows users to control various options for the application as a whole and individual tabs within the application. Each Tab in VisibleTesla has it's own section within the preferences tab. There are also general preferences for the app as a whole. To set the preferences associated with a given tab, click the arrow next to the Tab name. The screen shot below shows the Preferences tab with the Login preferences selected. As you can see, there are currently no preferences available for this tab.

            <p>
                The preferences associated with some tabs are split into two groups: Basic and Advanced. In general, you should avoid changing the advanced options.

                            Location data can come in quite rapidly when viewing the Locations tab. VisibleTesla doesn't store every single piece of data. You can specify the minimum time between samples using this slider. Note that this does not impact how frequently data comes into VisibleTesla. It only specifies how much data is stored.

                            Allows you to set the value used by the "Charge: Low" Scheduler command. By default this is set to the car's notion of minimum charging level. You can use the slider to set it to some other value.

                            These checkboxes allow the user to determine what sorts of power safety checks should apply to commands in the Scheduler UI that may consume significant power.

                            Lets the user determine whether clicking on a tab should cause a refresh and consequently wake up the car if it is sleeping. If this box is unchecked, clicking on a tab while in sleep mode will not refresh the data (meaning it will be stale). This allows the user to look at the last data displayed in a tab without waking the car up.

                            Allows the user to set the Idle Threshold. This determines how long VisibleTesla will look for inactivity before entering Sleep or Daydream mode. The default is 15 minutes. It can be set to anywhere between 1 and 90 minutes.

                            Controls how much data should be loaded. You can load the last 7, 14, or 30 days, the last week, the last month, all of your data, or none of your data. If you select to load none of your data, the graph will start out empty and add data points as usual. Normally this preference will be honored the next time VisibleTesla is launched. Changing this preference will not cause existing graph data to reload. However, if you change this preference before going to the Graphs tab, it will be honored immediately.

                            Allows the user to select where to store internal application data files. In general users should not check this box. It is provided for power-users and to maintain compatibility with older versions. The default setting will cause internal application data files to be stored in a location appropriate to the platform. This location differs between Mac, Linux, and Windows. You can determine this location by clicking the "Show User Folder" button.

This may provide you with higher usage limits on Google Maps related actions. <b>If you check this box and supply an invalid key, the Location tab and the Trips tab will fail without notice.</b> If you are a developer and want to learn more about the Google Maps API and how to get a key, please refer to <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial">Google's documentation</a>.

                            Advanced users may supply their own API key for MailGun. This is the service used to send notifications via email. It is up to you to set up an account with MailGun and agree to their terms of service. Supplying your own key provides no new functionality. It does, however, provide better privacy and may help to avoid usage limits. If you don't supply your own key, a default account is used and logging information is available to the author of VisibleTesla who administers the account. Please do not use this setting unless you are comfortable acquring your own MailGun key.

To use this feature, check the "Enable Proxy" checkbox and fill in valid settings for "Proxy Host" and "Proxy Port". Your network administrator will provide these settings to you. Note that this is an HTTP proxy, not a SOCKS proxy. <strong>Note</strong>: This feature has not yet been field tested. It should be considered experimental.

Set the font scale to a value lower than 100% to reduce VisibleTesla's font size. Some experimentation may be necessary to find the right scaling. You must quit and restart VisibleTesla before the setting will take effect.
