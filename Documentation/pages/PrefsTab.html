                The Preferences tab allows users to control various options for the application as a whole and individual tabs within the application. Each Tab in VisibleTesla has it's own section within the preferences tab. There are also general preferences for the app as a whole. To set the preferences associated with a given tab, click the arrow next to the Tab name. The screen shot below shows the Preferences tab with the Login preferences selected. As you can see, there are currently no preferences available for this tab.

            <p>
                The preferences associated with some tabs are split into two groups: Basic and Advanced. In general, you should avoid changing the advanced options.

                The available preferences are shown in the table below.

                            Checking this box tells VisibleTesla to stream location data opportunistically even when not on the Location Tab. When the car is not moving this will have no net effect. When the car is moving, additional location data will be captured. On very short trips or when the app is daydreaming, you may not see additional data.

If this box is unchecked, clicking on a tab while in sleep mode will not refresh the data (meaning it will be stale). This allows the user to look at the last data displayed in a tab without waking the car up.

If you select to load none of your data, the graph will start out empty and add data points as usual. Normally this preference will be honored the next time VisibleTesla is launched. Changing this preference will not cause existing graph data to reload. However, if you change this preference before going to the Graphs tab, it will be honored immediately.

It is up to you to set up an account with MailGun and agree to their terms of service. Supplying your own key provides no new functionality. It does, however, provide better privacy and may help to avoid usage limits. If you don't supply your own key, a default account is used and logging information is available to the author of VisibleTesla who administers the account. Please do not use this setting unless you are comfortable acquiring your own MailGun key.
