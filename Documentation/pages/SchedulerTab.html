            </h1>
            <p>
                VisibleTesla includes the capability to run scheduled activities like charging your car or turning on/off your air conditioning. For scheduled events to be executed, Visible Tesla must be running. That is, if you schedule your vehicle to turn on the HVAC system at 7:30AM so that your car is warm by the time you get to it at 7:45, then VisibleTesla must be running at 7:30AM to issue the commands. The screen shot below shows the Scheduler Tab.

                Each row represents a command that can be scheduled independently. There are 16 rows meaning that up to 16 distinct schedules can be set. Only 8 rows are visible at a time. A scrollbar provides access to the full list. The fields for each row are as follows:

                            If selected, the command will be executed one time and then this schedule item will be automatically disabled. For example, let's say you want to pre-heat the car at 6:00AM tomorrow morning, but that is a special case. You only want to do that tomorrow. You could remember to go back into the scheduler tomorrow afternoon and disable this item, but by using the <span class="ui">Once</span> checkbox, you don't have to.

                                Note that when you select this option, a button appears next to the command name. The button is labeled with a "+" to indicate that there are more options. Pressing this button pops up a dialog box that allows you to select the target temperature. When the <span class="ui">HVAC On</span> command runs at its scheduled time, VisibleTesla will first set the temperature to the desired level.

                                The temperature options dialog lets you use a slider to select a temperature, or you can type a value into a text box. Alternatively, you can select a checkbox named "Use the car's set point". If you do that, the slider and text box will be greyed out and the temperature will not be set to a new value. In this case, it will just use the car's current temperature setting.

Press the button and select the desired charge level just as you would for the <span class="ui">Charge: Start</span> command. When <span class="ui">Charge: Set</span> is executed, it will set the car's charge target to the specified level, but will not start the charging process.

                <b>Note</b>: The Sleep, Daydream, and Stay Awake commands can be used, for example, to tell the app to sleep at night and daydream during the day. Executing one of these commands simply causes the app to enter the associated inactivity mode. The app must still be idle for 15 minutes before it will sleep or daydream.
