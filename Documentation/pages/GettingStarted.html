            <p>
                VisibleTesla lets you view, monitor, and control your Tesla Model S in much the same way as the official Tesla iPhone and Android apps do. Unlike those apps, VisibleTesla is not official, not from Tesla, and not supported. Please read the <a href="#disclaimer">Disclaimer</a> below. It is important. The author created VisibleTesla in his spare time for the enjoyment of the Tesla community.
            </p>
            <p>
                VisibleTesla is free for personal and non-commercial use. It speaks to your Tesla in the same way that the official Tesla applications do. Several members of the <a href="http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/forum.php">Tesla Motors Club Forum</a> spent long hours determing how that mechanism works. Many thanks for their hard work.
            </p>
            <p>
                VisibleTesla has a tabbed interface with one tab per functional area. At the right of this (and every) page you'll see a Table of Contents. Each tab has it's own page. You'll see a number of screenshots hroughout this guide. These images may not reflect exactly what you'll see. For example, most screenshots are from a Mac and not every screenshot is updated on every release.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of the action In VisibleTesla happens within the tabs, but there are also three three menus: File, Options, and Help. Items from the first two menus are described along with the most relevant tab. The Help menu allows you to bring up this documentation, the release notes, and a general "About" dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next section describes how to install and run VisibleTesla.

                <a name="install">Installing, Running, and Updating VisibleTesla</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                <strong>System Requirements:</strong> VisibleTesla is a multi-platform application. It is developed on a Mac, but runs on Macs, Windows, and Linux. People are using it on a regular basis on systems such as Windows 7 &amp; 8, 32 and 64 bit, Mac OS 10.8 &amp; 10.9, and various flavors of Linux. It has also been run in virtualized environments such as VMware, though a few problems have been reported. In particular, you may need to disable 3D acceleration in order to avoid screen display issues. This is a low level problem that can't be addressed in VisibleTesla.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dependencies:</strong> VisibleTesla is a Java application and requires that you have a modern version of Java installed on your system. If you already have Java installed, you may be able to skip this step. However, VisibleTesla requires a recent version of Java so you may have to update your Java installation if it is old. You can download Java for Windows, Mac, and Linux from Java.com using the links below:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.xml">Windows</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_install.xml">Mac</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/linux_install.xml">Linux</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Be careful when installing Java for Windows. It may ask you to install other software from Oracle partners. You do not need this software to run VisibleTesla and may safely decline the installation.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Installing and Running:</strong> The very first thing you need to do is download and install VisibleTesla. You can do so by following these steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can always find the latest version (along with some older versions) <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/y1tj7fx9i72beo6/6lvCXtGbBR/VisibleTesla">here</a>.
                </li>
                <li>Choose the latest version and download it to your computer. The file you download will have a name like "VisibleTesla 0.25.00.zip".
                </li>
                <li>As you can see, it is a zip file and the contents need to be extracted in order to run the app. The extraction process differs for Windows, Mac, and Linux, but it typically amounts to double-clicking the downloaded file and potentially pressing an "extract" button.
                </li>
                <li>Once you have expanded the zip file you will be left with a folder with the same name, but without the ".zip" extension. Locate that folder. You can place this folder any where you like, or leave it where it is.
                </li>
                <li>Open the folder and find the file named "visibletesla.jar". That is the application.
                </li>
                <li>Now just double-click that file and VisibleTesla will launch.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you have trouble launching VisibleTesla, please consult the <a href="FAQ.html">FAQ</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/showthread.php/19975-VisibleTesla">forum</a>. Typical problems include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Mac: Permission to run the application may be denied based on your security settings.
                </li>
                <li>Windows: Some users believed they unzipped the downloaded file, but actually only viewed the content.
                </li>
                <li>General: If you did not install or update Java, the application may not run or run properly.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The FAQ and forum also provide tips that make it easier to launch VisibleTesla by creating shortcuts. None of those steps are necessary, but they may be of interest.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Updating VisibleTesla
            </h3>
            <p>
                Once you've installed and run VisibleTesla it will automatically check for updates on a weekly basis. If an update is available, a dialog box will provide a link to the Release Notes so that you can see what changed. If you'd like to update you'll see another link which will download the most recent version for you. You can also check for new updates at any time using the "Help-&gt;Check for Updates" menu item. When you download a newer version of VisibleTesla, you'll end up with a new folder with a higher version number. Quit the version of VisibleTesla that you are using, and start it from the new folder. You may delete the older folder after that.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p><em>Be careful</em> when using this software as it can lock and unlock your car as well as control various functions relating to the charging system, sun roof, lights, horn, and other subsystems of the car. Don't send your username and password to anyone other than Tesla. Doing so would give away the authentication details required to control your car. VisibleTesla does not store your password and only communicates with Tesla.</p>

                    Use this application at your own risk. The author does not guarantee its proper functioning. This application attempts to use the same interfaces used by the official Tesla apps. However, it is possible that use of this application may cause unexpected damage for which nobody but you are responsible. Use of this application can change the settings on your car and may have negative consequences such as (but not limited to) unlocking the doors, opening the sun roof, or reducing the available charge in the battery.
