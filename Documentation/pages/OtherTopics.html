                The simulation menu can be found within the Options menu. It allows you to look at car configurations other than your own. These screen shots show changing the color to red and using 21" dark rims.

                When viewing any tab you may refresh the displayed data by pressing the "Refresh" button. If you don't press the button, the app will automaticaly refresh the information every 30 seconds. The screen shot below shows the "spinner" that is displayed when the app is communicating with the vehicle. Switching tabs automatically refreshes the newly selected tab.

                In order to ensure that Tesla's servers do not become overloaded, the app automatically monitors the rate at which it makes requests. If you manually press refresh multiple times in rapid succession, you may find that the spinner rotates for a longer than usual. The app is automatically slowing down its requests to Tesla's servers in order to remain a good citizen. The app may also choose to refresh certain items less frequently than others. For example, the odometer reading on the <a href="OverviewTab.html">Overview Tab</a>. Since even at 60 mph the reading doesn't change much every minute, the app does not update it on every refresh. If the user presses the refresh button, it will force a new reading. Otherwise it is updated less frequently.
