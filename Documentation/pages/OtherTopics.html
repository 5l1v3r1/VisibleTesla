                <a name="exportingData">Exporting Your Data</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                You can export the data collected by VisibleTesla to an Excel file for your own analysis. There are two sets of data you can export:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Statistics: The data that was gathered for the <a href="GraphsTab.html">Graphs Tab</a>. You can export this data using <span class="ui">File→Export Stats Data...</span> menu item.
                </li>
                <li>Locations: The data that was gathered for the <a href="LocationTab.html">Location Tab</a>. You can export this data using <span class="ui">File→Export Location Data...</span> menu item.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                In either case you'll be prompted to choose a location and name for the exported file. Be sure to use the extension ".xls"; for example, MyStats.xls. The screen shot below shows the Export menu items.
            </p><img class="screenshot" src="../images/16_Export.png" alt="Export Stats">
            <p>
                After you choose a file and location, you'll be asked how much of your data you want to export. You can select a range of days on the calendar by selecting the starting day then holding down the shift key and selecting the <span class="tooltip" tip="Actually, you can select the days in any order">ending day</span>. You can use the <span class="ui">Quick Select</span> dropdown list to easily select some common ranges. Once you've selected your range, press the <span class="ui">Selected</span> button. If you want to export all of your data, you don't need to bother with the calendar, just press the <span class="ui">All</span> button. To abort the export process, hit the <span class="ui">Cancel</span> button. This screen shot shows the dialog box that allows you to select a date range.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="../images/16a_Export_DateRange.png" alt="Export Date Range">
            </p>
            <p>
                When you open an exported file in Excel, you'll see a column corresponding to the time at which each reading was taken and a column for each type of data collected. The time column contains a long, unintelligible number which is an accurate, though obscure, way to keep track of time down to the millisecond. You'll notice that the last column has a version of the timestamp represented as a human-readable date. The table will look something like the one below (a sample of the stats data):
            </p>

                You may notice that some entries are blank. This is normal and can happen for a number of reasons. For example, the car may not have provided readings for that statistic at that time.

            <h2>
                <a name="vampireLoss">Tracking Vampire Loss</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                "Vampire Loss" is the name given to power that is drained from the battery while the car is stationary. This power goes into running the car's onboard systems and is minimized when the car is sleeping. VisibleTesla can help you track how much power you are losing while your car is sitting still. It will review your data and look for any period where your car is stationary (and not charging) for an hour or more. These are called "rest periods." For each rest period it keeps track of when the period started and ended, and the starting and ending range (in miles or km).
            </p>
            <p>
                You can access this data in several forms using the <span class="ui">File&rarr;Vampire Loss...</span> menu item as shown below. Once you do that, a Date Range dialog will appear (see below). Choose a day or range of days that you want to review. You can use the <span class="ui">Quick Select</span> dropdown to easily choose common ranges. Days for which data is available are highlighted in green. If you want more days of historical data available, adjust the value of the <span class="ui">Load data for</span> preference in the <span class="ui">General / Basic Preferences</span> section of the <a href=PrefsTab.html>Prefs Tab</a>. If you choose days for which there is no data, no information will be shown.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                Once you've selected a date range, a new window will appear with three sections: <span class="ui">Raw Data</span>, <span class="ui">Sequence</span>, and <span class="ui">By Time</span>. As can be seen in the screen shot below, the <span class="ui">Raw Data</span> pane shows a dump of all of the rest periods and a summary of the overall Vampire Loss averaged across all of those periods.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="../images/26c_Vampire_Raw_Data.png" alt="Vampire Raw Data">
            </p>
            <p>
                The <span class="ui">Sequence</span> chart simply displays a scatter plot of each of the rest periods in sequence. The y axis represents the amount of vampire loss (in miles lost per hour or km lost per hour), and the x axis is just a sequence number. If you hover your mouse over any data point a pop-up will be displayed that gives information about that rest period. You'll also notice a green line across the entire chart. It represents the average vampire loss across all rest periods (in miles lost per hour or km lost per hour). If you hover your mouse over any data point a pop-up will be displayed with additional information. In the screen shot below, the mouse is hovering over the end of the average line, so the pop-up displays the average.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="../images/26d_Vampire_Scatter.png" alt="Vampire Scatter Chart">
            </p>
            <p>
                The final chart is called <span class="ui">By Time</span>. Like the previous chart, the y axis represents the amount of vampire loss. There is also a line across the entire chart which represents the overall average. That's where the similarities end. In this chart the x axis represents the hour of the day from 0-23. Each rest period is represented by a horizontal line segment which spans the starting time through the ending time of the period. The height of the line segment represents the degree of loss. Let's say your car is staionary every day from 10:00-14:00. You'll see a line segment for that period for each day in the range you selected.
            </p>
            <p>
                This chart can be used to get a feel for when you car tends to be stationary and how much vampire loss there is during these periods. As with the <span class="ui">Sequence</span> chart, you can hover your mouse over any endpoint to see more detailed information about that rest period. If a period spans days (very common), it will be shown as two segments. In cases where your car sits idle for multiple days (what a shame!), the period will be broken up into multiple segments as needed.

            <h2>
                <a name="autorefresh">Data Collection and Auto-Refresh</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many of the Tabs in VisibleTesla collect data of one type or another to do their job. The Location Tab collects location-related data, the Charge Tab collects charge-related data, and so on. They only collect this data when they are the selected tab. For example, while you are viewing the Charge Tab it is collecting charge data, but as soon as you switch to the Location Tab, the Charge Tab stops collecting data and the Location Tab starts. A number of tabs don't collect any data (e.g. Login, Prefs). Some tabs collect data only as needed (e.g. Scheduler).
            </p>
            <p>
                The Graphs Tab is special - it collects data even when you aren't viewing it. It's also opportunistic. It watches the data being collected by other Tabs and looks for anything it can use. In normal circumstances the Graphs Tab collects data every two minutes. If it sees your car in motion, it starts collecting data every 30 seconds. If your car stops, it continues collecting data every 30 seconds for a couple of minutes in case you're at a stop light or something like that. Eventually it will rever to collecting data at 2 minute intervals.
            </p>
            <p>
                When viewing any tab you may refresh the displayed data by pressing the <span class="ui">Refresh</span> button. If you don't press the button, the app will automatically refresh the information every 30 seconds. Switching tabs automatically refreshes the newly selected tab. The screen shot below shows the "spinner" that is displayed when the app is communicating with your car.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Location Tab is a little different from the others. It auto-refreshes like other tabs, but when the car is in motion it uses a special feature called "Streaming" that allows it to collect data at a higher rate without overloading Tesla's servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img class="screenshot" src="../images/12_Auto_Refresh.png">
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of overloading Tesla's servers, VisibleTesla automatically monitors the rate at which it makes requests. If you manually press refresh multiple times in rapid succession, you may find that the spinner rotates for a longer than usual. The app is automatically slowing down its requests to Tesla's servers in order to remain a good citizen. The app may also choose to refresh certain items less frequently than others. For example, the odometer reading on the <a href="OverviewTab.html">Overview Tab</a>. Since even at 60 mph the reading doesn't change much every minute, the app does not update it on every auto-refresh.
            </p>

                The simulation menu can be found within the Options menu. It allows you to look at car configurations other than your own. These screen shots show changing the color to red and using 21" dark rims.
