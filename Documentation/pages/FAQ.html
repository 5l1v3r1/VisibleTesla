                    There are many features of the Tesla Model S that cannot be controlled by VisibleTesla (or other applications). All of the following have been requested, but are not controllable via VisibleTesla:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The heated seats
                        </li>
                        <li>The front and rear defrosters
                        </li>
                        <li>The car's scheduled charge time
                        </li>
                        <li>The charge amperage
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    Can I get VisibleTesla in my native language?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    Unfortunately no (unless your native language is US English). There is actually a lot of work to be done to make VisibleTesla able to support different languages and then someone would have to do the actual translations. As of 1/1/2014, this work is not planned.

                    How do I switch between my many different Teslas?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    For those of you lucky enough to have more than one Tesla, there is no easy way to switch between them at the moment. Since I only have one car, this is not something I can test and is unlikely to be addressed anytime soon. You can keep multiple copies of VisibleTesla running and point one to each car.

                    Why does the Graphs Tab collect data very often some times and less frequently at other times?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    If you check out the section on <a href="OtherTopics.html#autorefresh">Data Collection</a> you'll see that the <a href="GraphsTab.html">Graphs Tab</a> is always collecting data in the background. It collects a sample of data every two minutes unless the app is asleep in which case it doesn't collect any data. See <a href="SleepMode.html">Understanding Sleep Mode</a> for more details.<br>
                    <br>
                    If VisibleTesla notices that your car is moving, it will collect data more frequently (every 30 seconds). There is one more twist. The Graphs Tab collects its own data, but it also snoops on the other tabs. If they collect anything of interest, the Graphs Tab plots that information and stores it away. For example, if you are viewing the Location Tab, the relevant data that it collects will also appear on the Graphs Tab at whatever rate the Location Tab is collecting data - usually every 30 seconds.<br>
                    <br>
                    This explains why you see data collected very quickly at some times and slower at others. Big gaps in the data typically represent times at which either (a) VisibleTesla wasn't running, (b) it was asleep, (c) your car was in an area with no cellular coverage.

                </dt>
                <dd>
                    The application data files are stored in a system specific location that can be shown using the "Show User Folder" button in <span class="ui">Prefs→General→Advanced</span>. If you are an advanced user you can use symbolic links (Mac/Linux) or MKLINK (Windows) to store the files in Dropbox and link them to User Folder.

                    Is VisibleTesla secure?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    VisibleTesla has not undergone a rigorous security analysis, but the <a href="#github">source code is available on github for anyone to review</a>. I welcome feedback on any security vulnerabilities that might be present. I understand that not everyone has the time, interest, or inclination to do that, but it is an option for some.<br>
                    <br>
                    Here are some basic facts about how VisibleTesla works:
                    <ul>
                        <li>VisibleTesla uses https to connect to Tesla's servers which means that all communication are encrypted.
                        </li>
                        <li>It does not store or communicate the user's password. It does store a cookie file on the user's disk. If this cookie file falls into the hands of an attacker, they could access your vehicle. An attacker would have to have access to your computer to make this possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>The application shares no information with the author or anyone else other than Tesla. I'd actually love to collect some aggregate statistics (not user identifiable) but I've refrained from doing so because I don't want to create even a perception that users are being spied upon. I don't even know how many people have tried VisibleTesla.
                        </li>
                    </ul>Other than communicating with Tesla, VisibleTesla communicates with two other services - Dropbox and MailGun. It uses Dropbox to download up to three files that are used in the update process:
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first file is a list of the releases. The app uses this to determine whether a newer release is available.
                        </li>
                        <li>If a new release is available, the user can click a link to see the most recent release notes. These notes are downloaded from Dropbox.
                        </li>
                        <li>Finally, if the user chooses to download the latest release, it will be downloaded from Dropbox. No user information is shared in this process.
                        </li>
                    </ul>if you use the notifications tab, your notification messages are sent via the MailGun hosted service. By default, logging information from that service is available to the author of VisibleTesla who administers the MailGun account. To avoid having this logging information visible, you may provide your own MailGun key. Please refer to this section on <a href="PrefsTab.html#mailgunkey">Advanced Preferences</a>.<br>
                    <br>
                    If you would like more certainty about what VisibleTesla is doing, you can use a program like Little snitch on the Mac to monitor and control all of VisibleTesla's network activity.

                <dd>
                    The best thing to do is ask about your problem on the <a href="http://www.teslamotorsclub.com/showthread.php/19975-VisibleTesla">Tesla Motors Club forum</a>. When reporting a bug please describe the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>What you expected to happen</b> and how you configured VisibleTesla to make it happen. For example: I expected a notification that the car was unplugged at 10:00PM because I set it up in the Scheduler Tab.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>What actually happened</b>, for example, 10:00PM came and went and I didn't get a notification even though my car was unplugged.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Screen shots</b> of the relevant Tabs if possible.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Your configuration</b> including version of VisibleTesla, which OS you're running on (e.g. Windows 8.1 or MacOS 10.9.1)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Whether it worked using Tesla's app</b>. Try the equivalent function on the iOS or Android app (if there is an equivalent function) to see if it works there but not in VisibleTesla.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        VisibleTesla keeps track of any internal errors or problems in a log file. This file is very important to the developer in the debugging process. It is very difficult to diagnose a problem without it (even with it, it can be difficult). A new log file is written every time you start the application. It is named <span class="ui">visibletesla-00.log</span> and lives in the application folder (the same place you go to launch VisibleTesla). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you notice a problem and wish to report it to the developer, quit VisibleTesla, copy the log file to a safe place (like your desktop) then start VisibleTesla again. If you quit and restart VisibleTesla before copying the log file, the previous version is still around. In fact, several old log files are kept around just in case. The old files are named <span class="ui">visibletesla-01.log</span> - <span class="ui">visibletesla-03.log</span>.

                </dt>
                <dd>
                    The two most common problems here are (a) the app is not running at the time the event occurred, and (b) the app is in <a href="SleepMode">"Allow Sleeping"</a> mode when the event occurred. When VisibleTesla is in "Allow Sleeping" mode it still checks the car periodically to see if it is awake. If the car is awake during one of these checks and if a specified event occurs, a notification will be sent. However, the top priority of "Allow Sleeping" mode is to let your car sleep which means that events may occur while VisibleTesla is avoiding communication with your vehicle.

                    VisibleTesla only loads as much historical information as you tell it to in the <span class="ui">Prefs→General→Basic→Load data for:</span> field. For example, if you have that set to 14 days, you won't see trips that are older than that. The same is true for the data in the <span class="ui">Graph Tab</span>.

                <dd>
                    VisibleTesla is not in the Mac App Store and is not a "signed" application. The Mac operating system is giving you a warning saying that you should be suspicious of any program that doesn't come from a known and verified source. That's good advice. If you feel that you want to run VisibleTesla anyway, there are several ways around this warning. If you are using Mac OS 10.9 or greater, the easiest way is:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Double-click VisibleTesla.jar, get the warning and dismiss it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Go to System <span class="ui">Preferences→Security &amp; Privacy</span>. You'll see a note that says "VisibleTesla was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer."
                        </li>
                        <li>Right next to that text you'll see an "Open Anyway" button. Press it. You only need to do this once.
                        </li>

                    I'm not a Developer. Is there anything I can contribute?

                    Yes! For example, you can test experimental versions of VisibleTesla, contribute to the documentation, and help others on the forums.

                    For Windows 7 or 8:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Install VisibleTesla as described <a href="GettingStarted.html#install">here</a>. Make a note of the directory location where you extracted the VisibleTesla files on your computer (for example: "C:\Program Files\VisibleTesla")
                        </li>
                        <li>Navigate to the directory identified in step 1 above. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Locate the file "VisibleTesla.jar". Right-click and select "Send to... / Desktop (create shortcut)".
                        </li>
                        <li>Right-click the desktop shortcut you just created in step #3 and choose "Properties"
                        </li>
                        <li>Click the "Change Icon" button. In the resulting dialog box, click "Browse".
                        </li>
                        <li>Navigate to the directory identified in step #1 and choose the "FobIcon.ico" file, and then click "Open".
                        </li>
                        <li>In the resulting dialog box, choose the (only) Tesla Keyfob shaped Icon and click "OK"
                        </li>
                        <li>Click "OK" again to close the Properties window
                        </li>
                        <li>You should now have a "Model S Fob" icon on your desktop that may be used to launch VisibleTesla.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    Mac: How can I get an icon in my dock that will let me launch VisibleTesla?
                </dt>
                <dd>
                    For recent versions of Mac OS X follow the instructions below or refer to this <a href="MacInstallOnDock.pdf">PDF</a> which provides the same instructions complete with images:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Download VisibleTesla by clicking on a download link or automatically, with the "Check for Updates" feature in the Application. A folder, named something like VisibleTesla 0.XX.XX will be placed in your Downloads folder.
                        </li>
                        <li>[Optional] Copy or move that complete folder to a location of your choice (typically you might place it in the Applications folder with all your other applications) and remember where you placed it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Open "Finder" and navigate to the folder that contains the VisibleTesla 0.XX.XX sub-folder. Double click on the folder to open it and view its contents.<br>
                            <b>Steps 4 to 11 are optional</b> and only necessary if you want to replace the default Java icon associated with VisibleTesla with an image of the Model S FOB. If not, skip to step 12.<br>
                        </li>
                        <li>Right Click on the VisibleTesla.jar file to open the context menu and click on "Get Info".
                        </li>
                        <li>A window called VisibleTesla.jar Info will open with the name of the file in bold at the top and a JAR icon to the left of this (with a coffee cup in the image). Keep this window open.
                        </li>
                        <li>Go back to "Finder" and double click on the Fobicon.png file the VisibleTesla 0.XX.XX sub-folder to open the FOB image in the "Preview" application.
                        </li>
                        <li>Copy the contents of the image in the "Preview" application by pressing "Command + C"
                        </li>
                        <li>Go back to the VisibleTesla.jar Info window from Step 5 and single click on the little coffee cup image at the top of the info window, not the image in the Preview section of the info window. The outside of the coffee cup image will be highlighted with a blue outline.
                        </li>
                        <li>Paste the FOB picture currently in the the clipboard by pressing "Command + V"
                        </li>
                        <li>The Model S FOB picture will replace the coffee cup picture (top left). Close the VisibleTesla.Jar Info window.
                        </li>
                        <li>Go back to "Finder" to view the VisibleTesla 0.XX.XX sub-folder again. The VisibleTesla.jar file should now have the Model S Fob image associated to it.
                        </li>
                        <li>Drag the VisibleTesla.jar file to either your desktop or to the Program Dock at the bottom. Note that you can only place such a file on the right side of the Dock (user items).
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        NOTE: If when clicking on your VisibleTesla dock icon you get an error message that you cannot open the file because it is from an unidentified developer you will need to right click the VisibleTesla.jar file in its original folder and select "Open With" and choose "Jar Launcher" [You only need to do this the first time. Subsequent attempts to open using the icon in the Doc should open the application without issue]
                    </p>

                        Thanks to TeslaMotorsClub user znino for providing the instructions and PDF file.
