            <p>
                The Charge Tab allows you to monitor and control your car's charging process. It let's you manually start or stop charging and it lets you set the charge target (the level to which you want the car to charge). Charging can also be started or stopped on a schedule using the <a href="SchedulerTab.html">Scheduler Tab</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                There are quite a few pieces of data in the Charge Tab as shown in the screen shot below. In this example, the car is not connected to a power source.
